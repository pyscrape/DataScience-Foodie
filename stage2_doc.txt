1) Entity   ->  Adjectives describing the food and dining experience
   Examples ->  <adj> yummy </adj> cocktails
	        "neat" place just right of broadway theatres
	        "whole" dining experience was great


2) Total number of mentions- 4145 + 1618

3) Set I: 220 documents, 4145 mentions, 6502 generated negative examples, Pruning-example words that are negative but have atleast one of the features present.

   Features used: < Length in chars,Is preceded by was/is/an/are/so, Is preceded by another adjective , Is preceded by very >


4) Set J: 100 documents, 1618 mentions.

5) Cross validation

Initial 10 fold cross validation with SVM -> < precision = 82%, recall = 3%> many false negatives. Inspected and found that features were not distinguishing enough.

Added feature -> Is succeded by noun ( food/place-name etc) , nouns detected by using python natural language toolkit library.

After this 10 fold cross validation with SVM -> < precision =84%,recall = 55%>. 


Further the second feature was separated and made into separate vectors rather than having a single boolean variable.
After this 10 fold CV with SVM: < P= 88%,recall=60%>

Classifier comparison table with 10 fold CV is given below

Classifier      |  Tuning-Technique |               P |     R |     F1
