i have a <adj> new </adj> appreciation for the state of texas because of this restaurant...

warning: if you're used to outback steakhouse or your grandmother's portions, you'll be sorely disappointed in the experience here at <adj> barley </adj> swine. it's a tasting menu for starts...

my husband and i are originally from san francisco: a place where there is an abundance of michelin star restaurants. this place combined the <adj> best </adj> of two of those restaurants : the <adj> modern </adj> and <adj> technical </adj> <adj> japanese </adj> cuisine of kusakabe, and the <adj> organic </adj>, <adj> down-to-earth </adj> <adj> seasonal </adj> menu of the village pub.

dish after dish we were surprised to see <adj> more </adj> than just <adj> all-around </adj> <adj> amazing-tasting </adj> food. there were plates presented to us with the look of a <adj> delicate </adj>, <adj> asian-inspired </adj> dish that tasted like the comforting meal that was roasted over your backyard fire pit. they used their sauces to tie in sweet, savory, fruity, and <adj> nutty </adj> elements throughout their courses - that's definitely a mark of a <adj> great </adj> restaurant who knows their stuff.

thank you, barley swine, for a <adj> wonderful </adj> food experience that was amazing from start to finish. the service was very <adj> cordial </adj> and the <adj> overall </adj> timing of the food was well planned and thought out. we've already invited <adj> more </adj> people for <adj> next </adj> time!

our experience
----------

<adj> sweet </adj> potato, goat cheese
- cheese usually goes over potatoes no? surprised at the crunchy shell that led to the <adj> soft </adj> cheese filling

beet cured mackerel and pine
- ironically, i'd describe this as an <adj> earthy </adj> seafood dish... it's amazing with what you did with the aftertaste. 

sunchoke custard
- man, you guys do deviled eggs well... i wish the apple bits were brought out a little more in the custard though. this was the only <adj> underwhelming </adj> dish you had tonight.

ember roasted squash, mesquite, toasted seeds
- wonderful unfolding of <adj> many </adj> flavors. technically well done

<adj> red </adj> shrimp, cauliflower, tangerine
- i hate shrimp. i love this dish. wth. shoutouts to the chef at the grill and the person who made the sauce. it was amazing, cooked perfectly, and beautifully balanced.

akaushi beef, oyster mushroom, seeded loaf
- the marrow broth had so much flavor. the ribeye steak was very <adj> tender </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj>. the arugula pesto could stand on its <adj> own </adj> with the bread but also be used to cut the saltiness in the leftover broth so well.

pork belly, cabbage, gulf xo sauce
- the <adj> southern </adj> sushi : a very <adj> unique </adj> <adj> dish </adj> where the cabbage is cooked like seaweed, but made the <adj> dish </adj> smell like a backyard bbq. tasted like some <adj> good </adj> shrimp and grits with <adj> fresh </adj>, <adj> pickled </adj> cabbage in tow to change it up.

duck, broccoli, fried duck egg 
- perfectly cooked duck with a <adj> great </adj> crisp on the skin. broccoli played a <adj> different </adj> role as an <adj> integral </adj> part of the dish rather than the <adj> typical </adj> side filler. did i say that that your sauces are on point?!

apple, lemon grass, koji rice pudding
- timed perfectly in the menu. <adj> great </adj> balance between <adj> sweet </adj>, nutty, fruity, tart, and milky. coconut and apple introduced <adj> great </adj> character in the dish while the <adj> crispy </adj> rice gave it the texture it needed.

<adj> dark </adj> chocolate ganache with caramel and tangerine
- <adj> great </adj> capper for the end. <adj> sweet </adj>, but not too <adj> sweet </adj>. really liked how the crust pulled in that citrusy, <adj> nutty </adj> flavor from the toppings on the ganache 

and thanks for the <adj> adorable </adj> pastries :) i would only complain about the tea as it didn't match the level of the food menu, but then again, who cares.
