gonna start the year off with reviewing a <adj> great </adj> recommendation from a co-worker!

getting here early is <adj> key </adj> but even though we did during the week between christmas and <adj> new </adj> years we had the standard long wait...in the cold at that.

totally <adj> worth </adj> the wait though.  i had the pappardelle bolognese and the castelvetrano olives along with the wonderfully <adj> baked </adj> <adj> rosemary </adj> bread.  the pasta was cooked an absolutely <adj> perfect </adj> al dente.  not only was it <adj> worth </adj> waiting in the cold for this meal but it was <adj> worth </adj> galavanting from downtown to pioneer square as well.

the seating can be shared so you get somewhat of a <adj> communal </adj> dining experience if you're into it.  the meal is a <adj> great </adj> value for what you get.  once you get through the line, the wait for the food is <adj> minimal </adj> and the service is very <adj> nice </adj>.

looking forward to another get-away here during the <adj> next </adj> work lull.
