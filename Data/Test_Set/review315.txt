we stumbled upon emf while walking around the les <adj> last </adj> weekend, and made it a point to come here immediately.

the les is filled with <adj> cozy </adj> <adj> little </adj> wine and cocktail bars, but this definitely one of the <adj> better </adj> ones.  the decor is <adj> amazing </adj>, the food is <adj> fantastic </adj>, and the portions are <adj> generous </adj>!

they have a <adj> happy </adj> hour until 8p, and we happened to arrive a bit before that and ordered a <adj> few </adj> glasses of the beaujolais which was <adj> fantastic </adj>! of course, this was accompanied by cheese and charcuterie, including camembert, ossau iraty and <adj> parisian </adj> ham. the portions were <adj> huge </adj>, but being a cheese and <adj> bread </adj> monger we took this down with ease.

<adj> great </adj> ambience and lovely <adj> hospitable </adj> service, will certainly be back soon!
