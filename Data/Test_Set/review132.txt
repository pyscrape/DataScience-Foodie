wait. how is it possible i haven't reviewed list yet? remedying this stat!

list has one of the <adj> best </adj> <adj> happy </adj> hours around, with quality food and reasonably priced bottles of wine. i've been here a number of times and always order the gnocchi, no matter what. they're <adj> light </adj>, <adj> pillowy </adj>, and smothered in that <adj> delicious </adj> <adj> black </adj> truffle cream sauce. as for the rest of the menu, you really can't go <adj> wrong </adj>. just close your eyes, point, and order whatever your finger lands on.
