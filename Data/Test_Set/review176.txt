how to be treated <adj> special </adj> on your birthday: go to barley. practically every person working came over to wish me <adj> happy </adj> birthday and that means a lot to me. 

<adj> old </adj> location vs. <adj> new </adj> location differences? well <adj> other </adj> than the building and the <adj> new </adj> street, you can still expect to receive the <adj> best </adj> service and the <adj> best </adj> food in town. it has always been <adj> such </adj> a treat dining here, seriously the service could not be <adj> better </adj>. it is still <adj> true </adj> that each person who works here genuinely appears to enjoy working here and it shows. the <adj> new </adj> building is <adj> beautiful </adj> inside and out and they've got a bit more space to work with now. 

and yes if you're wondering, barley is <adj> meat-free </adj> <adj> friendly </adj>! just let them know a <adj> few </adj> days in advance when you make your reservation and they will happily accommodate and accept the challenge! we feasted for almost 3 hours on <adj> delicious </adj> meatless food from the chef's tasting menu. the alcohol pairing was a <adj> nice </adj> addition to the experience and it really was a lot of alcohol to be <adj> honest </adj>. make <adj> sure </adj> you have a dd and also expect to get <adj> tipsy </adj> enough to pass out fully clothed once you stumble into bed. birthday=successful. <adj> i </adj> could go on and on about how <adj> great </adj> the food is, but you already know that to be <adj> factual </adj>. <adj> i </adj>'m so <adj> glad </adj> to have <adj> such </adj> a <adj> great </adj> <adj> innovative </adj> restaurant break up with the south and emerge <adj> victorious </adj> on the <adj> north </adj> side.
