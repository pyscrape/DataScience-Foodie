i've been trying to get over here since the start of summer and today it finally happened! <adj> grabbed </adj> lunch here on a whim with some coworkers and it totally met all expectations.

i ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and a <adj> small </adj> side of the <adj> korean </adj> fried chicken (in case you haven't seen my <adj> recent </adj> reviews, i have a <adj> new </adj> obsession). i was <adj> hesitant </adj> to order the bibimbap to-go since the stone bowl is such an <adj> enjoyable </adj> part of the experience but nonetheless, this was still really <adj> great </adj>. i'm <adj> glad </adj> i asked for a side of some type of spicy sauce because it took this dish to the <adj> next </adj> level. 

if you're ordering pickup/to-go, i suggest calling it in as it does take a <adj> little </adj> bit of time to prepare. the interior is <adj> small </adj> so i wouldn't recommend it for <adj> eat-in </adj> if you're <adj> more </adj> than a party of 2, maybe 3.
