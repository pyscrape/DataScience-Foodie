seattle has gotten the pok bug and if you're trying to figure out which one to try, you should definitely try this one. i can tell you which ones to avoid, but what's the point? you might as well just try the ones i tell you to (:

they have a ton of options- their <adj> own </adj> creations or make your <adj> own </adj>. salmon, ahi, tofu, tako, etc. i decided to get the 12th man bowl because i love spicy and i love salmon. you can make it into a salad, rice bowl, or a burrito. i went bowl- <adj> white </adj> rice, spicy salmon, spicy ahi, <adj> classic </adj> salmon. seaweed salad, krab salad, edamame, masago, fried shallots, cucumber, and avocado (and yes, it's <adj> extra </adj>, and yes, it's worth it every single time) and a <adj> little </adj> <adj> extra </adj> spicy mayo on the side. i loved it. <adj> good </adj> size portions and <adj> flavourful </adj>. fishies were a <adj> good </adj> size and i was definitely <adj> full </adj> afterwards. though, like 45th (which i've mentioned before...i get it, <adj> broken </adj> record, however...), i wish they seasoned their rice and it wasn't <adj> warm </adj>, but still try this place. afterwards, we decided on dole whip. do not skip out on it. and the homemade mochi ice cream. basically- don't skip out on this place.
