i like that emmer & rye constantly changes up their menus based on season, but that means that writing about <adj> specific </adj> dishes isn't all that helpful as you are <adj> unlikely </adj> to see the <adj> same </adj> things on the menu when you visit.  that said there are two items everyone at our table agreed were <adj> wonderful </adj>: the kale and lentils salad, and the lentils and goat cheese toast (it tasted as <adj> good </adj> as it looks).  we tried a couple of their <adj> freshly </adj> spun pastas which were very <adj> tasty </adj> but not easily shared.  the <adj> roasted </adj> carrots <adj> good </adj> but not <adj> memorable </adj>. for dessert we had the ice cream sandwich; it just didn't do it for me.  after we were served the pastas, appetizers and sides, then the dim sum carts came rolling our way.  unfortunately, we were too <adj> full </adj> by then to try those temptations.

<adj> pro </adj> tip: wait for the dim sum carts before going "all in".....
