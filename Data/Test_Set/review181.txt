the food is <adj> superb </adj>, and - nobody goes here any <adj> more </adj>, it's too <adj> crowded </adj>!

of course, people come here, in droves. i suggest coming before 11:30. my friend was late so i got to watch a <adj> weekday </adj> parade of diners come through between 11:45 and 12:15 when my friend finally arrived - i have seen that you can get a seat; it's <adj> easier </adj> if there's two of you.

and, the reason why is that the food is superb. end of story. the pasta is - the <adj> best </adj> ever. ok, maybe there's the <adj> great </adj> <adj> roman </adj> place you remember (it wasn't in <adj> campo </adj> di fiori, that's for <adj> sure </adj>) or what have you, but as far as <adj> seattle </adj> is concerned, it's the <adj> best </adj> ever. there's no contest. <adj> il </adj> corvo is the pasta champion.

this is an <adj> awesome </adj> moment in <adj> seattle </adj> <adj> culinary </adj> history. it's kind of a pain to pay $4/hr to park three blocks away and then wait in a line that moves slowly and then rushes forward and then stops again . . . and then you sit down and you realize that you have never ever not even one time had pasta this <adj> good </adj> - and if by some miracle you did, then you thank the stars above that you got one <adj> more </adj> chance again.

the future is <adj> uncertain </adj>. get her as quickly as you can. come back as often as you can. and - let me put it this way: thanks to marcella hazan, you can make a <adj> great </adj> bolognese at home, but you can't come anywhere near this pasta. nobody can. get in here, while the getting's <adj> good </adj>!
