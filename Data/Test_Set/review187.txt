this is by far the most <adj> busiest </adj> tourist attraction <adj> italian </adj> restaurant <adj> i </adj> have seen so far! <adj> i </adj> literally waited almost an hour and half to try there <adj> infamous </adj> pasta!!! it was <adj> worth </adj> it at the end of the visit. 

if <adj> i </adj> were to go again <adj> i </adj> would definitely pick a day that <adj> i </adj> will be <adj> willing </adj> to wake up early and wait in line before the place <adj> open </adj>. there <adj> restaurant </adj> hour is <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> short </adj> but <adj> i </adj> don't see it surprising at all. it's from 11am to 3pm! 

after waited for an hour when me and my friend were in the restaurant lol you still have to wait until you get to the front to order your food! they have <adj> daily </adj> specialties or something. i ordered one of them "forgot the name" but it was <adj> delicious </adj>. there home made bread was <adj> great </adj> too very <adj> soft </adj> and buttery in every bite. they should be thinking of expanding their business! the restaurant isn't that <adj> big </adj>. anyway!

the price is very <adj> affordable </adj> for some freshly made <adj> italian </adj> pasta ! if you are a <adj> big </adj> eater i would recommended order two order pasta and a side of there <adj> handmade </adj> bread. :) oh and <adj> friendly </adj> cashier who took my order because i really have no clue how to say there item on there menu! haha!
