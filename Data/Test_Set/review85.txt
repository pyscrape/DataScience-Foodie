while i was looking for something <adj> light </adj> and <adj> easy </adj> digest, i came across this place through yelp. the reviews seem <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> nice </adj> and the photos looked amazing so i decided to give this place a try. i got <adj> spicy </adj> tuna poke bowl ($10) and while it is definitely a lot <adj> pricier </adj> than <adj> most </adj> dishes in chinatown, the portion was <adj> huge </adj> and <adj> healthier </adj> (less <adj> oily </adj>). i wouldn't say the fish was <adj> super </adj> <adj> fresh </adj> but it was definitely <adj> decent </adj> with other vegetables. i would come back if i'm craving poke bowl again!
