tonight was our <adj> second </adj> time to eat at barley swine...another triumph!!  from the <adj> crazy </adj> sounding cocktails to food with flavors we couldn't possibly fathom to the personalized and <adj> perfect </adj> service from oscar and the other staff...this is the place to dine!  everyone made us feel so <adj> special </adj> making tonight the <adj> perfect </adj> <adj> anniversary </adj> dinner!  there's not a doubt in my mind that we'll be back!
