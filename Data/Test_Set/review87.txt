the poke at simple is some of the <adj> best </adj> i've had! we tried both the spicy tuna and <adj> ahi </adj> tuna bowls. both were <adj> delicious </adj> but the <adj> ahi </adj> tuna stood out - served over a <adj> healthy </adj> portion of <adj> brown </adj> rice and <adj> numerous </adj> toppings (such as pickles veggies, ginger, avocado, wonton crisps, etc), the <adj> ahi </adj> tuna steak was thinly sliced and perfectly seared on the outside/raw on the inside. also, the taro <adj> bubble </adj> tea was out of this world.

the service was <adj> super </adj> <adj> friendly </adj> and even though the restaurant is <adj> small </adj>, it's <adj> comfortable </adj> and we were <adj> able </adj> to easily grab two seats for dinner. highly recommend!
