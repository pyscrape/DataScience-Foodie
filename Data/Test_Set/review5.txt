we went to dee dee <adj> last </adj> wednesday or thursday, and are already looking forward to our <adj> next </adj> trip! we parked in a neighborhood around the corner since this is on a <adj> busy </adj> street- just check signs and you should be <adj> good </adj>. 

we went early so there was no one else around eating yet, but the gentleman (owner?) at the window walked us through the menu. <adj> i </adj> mentioned my aversion to things to spicy and he gave me <adj> great </adj> suggestions and even asked his wife (<adj> i </adj> think? the one cooking!) to use <adj> less </adj> spice in my dish so <adj> i </adj> could enjoy it. 

my husband and i ordered the papaya salad and the pad ka pow and we were really impressed. they were both so delicious- the papaya salad was so <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> light </adj> on a brutally <adj> hot </adj> day, and the pad ka pow was a <adj> serious </adj> kick of heat (when we added the <adj> extra </adj> <adj> hot </adj> sauce.) 

we wanted to try the <adj> mango </adj> rice but they said they weren't <adj> able </adj> to get <adj> good </adj> <adj> mango </adj> that day, but we're looking forward to trying it <adj> next </adj> time.

i was so <adj> happy </adj> they had la croix as a beverage option, not just soda or water. 

okay, <adj> i </adj>'m already getting <adj> hungry </adj> again just writing this. do yourself a favor and go to dee dee now. they're <adj> nice </adj> people, the food is <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>, and what else do you need to know?
