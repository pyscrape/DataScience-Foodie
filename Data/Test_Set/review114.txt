i love this bar lounge near times <adj> square </adj>.  the yelp reviews were right on target.   <adj> nice </adj> drink menu with some specialty cocktails. i tried  <adj> several </adj> but the mule was my <adj> favorite </adj> by a  long shot.   i also tried  <adj> several </adj> appetizers and they were all <adj> great </adj>.  the devil eggs were definitely the star of the night!  the tuna appetizer was also <adj> super </adj>.  i will be coming back here every time i come to <adj> new </adj> york.  <adj> small </adj> and <adj> intimate </adj> setting.  <adj> nice </adj> background music playing.
