<adj> first </adj> time we visited here on a <adj> monday </adj> morning at 1130am, there was a line out the door. the <adj> second </adj> time we tried coming an hour before closing and there was almost no line with several <adj> open </adj> tables. so, pick your timing well if you don't feel like waiting in a line! at this restaurant you order your food <adj> first </adj> and then sit down, so it's frowned upon to save a seat before you order.

the menu here is always changing but the pastas are always <adj> delicious </adj>! 
we ordered 1 of each pasta because we just couldn't choose! there were 2 pappardelle pastas and a gigli pasta. there was the pappardelle de bolognese which is the more <adj> common </adj> pasta on their menu, and then the other pappardelle had anchovies but that was our <adj> least </adj> <adj> favorite </adj>. our <adj> favorite </adj> turned out to be the <adj> vegetarian </adj> gigli pasta with a <adj> rich </adj> and <adj> creamy </adj> sauce that was to die for. we also ordered some focaccia which was <adj> soft </adj> and airy and made for a <adj> great </adj> appetizer or mop for your <adj> extra </adj> sauce.

<adj> overall </adj>, the pasta here was some of the <adj> best </adj> we've ever had and the staff there are <adj> super </adj> friendly. if you end up coming at a <adj> busy </adj> time you may end up having to share a table with another party. for $9 a pasta, i'm most definitely going to make a trip back here the <adj> next </adj> time i am craving some pasta!
