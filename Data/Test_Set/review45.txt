what gopoke does well: aloha spirit, the staff that was aiding me and my friends was above it. they are on a <<adj> adj </adj>> whole </<adj> adj </adj>> <<adj> adj </adj>> new </<adj> adj </adj>> level of customer service. claps for the time they took to let me sample, make a choice, and learn about all the toppings. i appreciated not being expected to rush despite how <<adj> adj </adj>> busy </<adj> adj </adj>> they were. the <<adj> adj </adj>> actual </<adj> adj </adj>> taste of the poke was <<adj> adj </adj>> <adj> delicious </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>>, <adj> healthy </adj> portions, and quality. <adj> best </adj> bowl i've had in <adj> seattle </adj> yet. to really just make a pleasure filled experience that much <adj> better </adj> the staff brought over 3 <adj> pineapple </adj> desserts <adj> complete </adj> with the li hi moi powder, and gummies. also points for how <adj> fast </adj> i saw the line grow, then die down because your staff keep it moving. 

if <adj> i </adj> could give them <adj> higher </adj>, <adj> i </adj>'d 6 star it. from the group that <adj> i </adj> came with to your staff, if you read this, thank you. you made the <adj> first </adj> visit a return one. 

what gopoke can work on: the parking. that was the <adj> only </adj> killer.
