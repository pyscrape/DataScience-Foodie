what gopoke does well: aloha spirit, the staff that was aiding me and my friends was above it. they are on a <adj> whole </adj> <adj> new </adj> level of customer service. claps for the time they took to let me sample, make a choice, and learn about all the toppings. i appreciated not being expected to rush despite how <adj> busy </adj> they were. the <adj> actual </adj> taste of the poke was <adj> delicious </adj>, <adj> healthy </adj> portions, and quality. <adj> best </adj> bowl i've had in <adj> seattle </adj> yet. to really just make a pleasure filled experience that much <adj> better </adj> the staff brought over 3 <adj> pineapple </adj> desserts <adj> complete </adj> with the li hi moi powder, and gummies. also points for how <adj> fast </adj> i saw the line grow, then die down because your staff keep it moving. 

if i could give them <adj> higher </adj>, i'd 6 star it. from the group that i came with to your staff, if you read this, thank you. you made the <adj> first </adj> visit a return one. 

what gopoke can work on: the parking. that was the only killer.
