what an <adj> authentic </adj> <adj> polish </adj> restaurant!  starting with the decor, the <adj> brown </adj> <adj> wooden </adj> benches, wishing well in the dining room, <adj> wooden </adj> cabin where the restrooms are; <adj> overall </adj> it had a very <adj> authentic </adj> feel!  there was about a 1 hour wait on a <adj> friday </adj> night but they were very accommodating in taking our number and calling us so we didn't have to stay in the restaurant and wait. 

my husband and i had the <adj> white </adj> borscht soup that came with a side of mash and bacon bits on top that was so <adj> delicious </adj>!  for dinner we had the roasted hocks and <adj> polish </adj> plater along with a <adj> polish </adj> village <adj> salad </adj>. every <adj> single </adj> item in the dishes were absolutely <adj> delightful </adj>!  we probably didn't need the <adj> salad </adj> since everything else was so <adj> filling </adj> but <adj> glad </adj> we got it to taste! 

we will definitely be back <adj> many </adj> <adj> more </adj> times so we can try all the dishes !
