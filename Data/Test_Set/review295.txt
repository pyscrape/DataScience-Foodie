based on the reviews, i had to try karczma for <adj> polish </adj> food in greenpoint. i'm now rubbing my <adj> satisfied </adj> belly after a serving of <adj> white </adj> borscht in a breadbowl, accompanied with <adj> mashed </adj> potatoes with bacon. i washed it down with a pint of tyskie lager and i am a <adj> happy </adj> <adj> polish </adj>-american. <adj> excellent </adj> value for nyc- <adj> soup-potatoes </adj> $5.50, beer $6. i'd absolutely come back to try <adj> more </adj>. 
also a <adj> great </adj> ambience with country style decor and <adj> gorgeous </adj> waitresses in <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> costume.
