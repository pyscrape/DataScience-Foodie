the kichin <adj> fried </adj> <adj> chicken </adj> bowl is extremely <adj> flavorful </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>. the <adj> fried </adj> crust is <adj> super </adj> crispy but the meat itself is still <adj> flavorful </adj> because it has been marinated separately so that it is infused with flavor. the gimbap was alright -- a <adj> little </adj> <adj> less </adj> flavored than i would have liked but still <adj> enjoyable </adj>. but by far and away the <adj> best </adj> part of our meal was the rice balls. holy hell the spicy salmon rice balls are <adj> phenomenal </adj>! spicy and fishy and absolutely out of this world with the kimchi aioli. definitely get these!

the prices are <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> standard </adj> but <adj> i </adj> think the rice balls are definitely the <adj> best </adj> value -- you get 3 rice balls for $10 and the rice balls are as <adj> big </adj> as a fist. that's a lot of food. we used the yelp check-in to get a <adj> free </adj> honeydew iced tea and that was <adj> perfect </adj> to go with the rest of the meal because it was refreshing and mildly flavored/sweet.

highly recommend. this spot is close to where we live so we will become regulars for <adj> sure </adj>.
