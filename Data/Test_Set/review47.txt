ever since i saw the sign that gopok would be opening in the id, i incessantly stalked their <adj> social </adj> media pages. the <adj> grand </adj> opening weekend was definitely "<adj> grand </adj>." the line was over an hour wait in chilly weather. staff members came out to bring samples of pok and dole whips. yum! everyone was in a pretty <adj> good </adj> mood and those who couldn't hang left the line to eat elsewhere. staff members are <adj> friendly </adj></adj> and always on the move. 

a <adj> few </adj> things set <adj> gopok </adj> apart from others. first, ahi is flown in <adj> daily </adj> from hawaii. <adj> second </adj>, the pok is marinated. yes, it's <adj> true </adj>! that adds <adj> deeper </adj> flavor to the <adj> overall </adj> experience. <adj> third </adj>, it <adj> expensive </adj>, but worth it. finally, they have dessert! 

the quality of the fish is <adj> obvious </adj> when you take your <adj> first </adj> bite. the texture and the flavor assure you that the fish is very <adj> fresh </adj>. the topping bar has just the <adj> right </adj> amount of the <adj> right </adj> ingredients such as crab salad, seaweed salad, edamame and the other <adj> usual </adj> suspects. i only eat <adj> ahi </adj> pok and this is the <adj> best </adj> quality i've tasted in awhile. i've tried the bowls and burritos; both are <adj> excellent </adj>. 

i'm a sucker for dessert and always try to convince business owners to invest in this <adj> critical </adj> aspect. gopok has <adj> shave </adj> <adj> ice </adj>, dole whips, and bubbies mochi <adj> ice </adj> cream. the <adj> shave </adj> <adj> ice </adj> is <adj> decent </adj> and i know i'll be back for <adj> more </adj> since it's <adj> hard </adj> to find <adj> good </adj> <adj> shave </adj> <adj> ice </adj> in seattle. i'm not a fan of pineapple but always eat dole whips. i haven't tried the dole whip floats yet but they look as yummy as they sound. either way, i have to get <adj> li </adj> hing <adj> mui </adj> powder on it!
