a <adj> few </adj> <adj> first </adj> impressions:

adam is a <adj> serious </adj> yet <adj> quick </adj> with a <adj> smile </adj> <adj> helpful </adj> manager. his beer recs for my man were spot on.
zack is the <adj> fastest </adj> moving bartender in austin. 
the interior is <adj> gorgeous </adj>. i love the <adj> neutral </adj> tones and <adj> unique </adj> spaces with the <adj> high </adj> and <adj> low </adj> tables. 
<adj> sunday </adj> dim sum is slightly <adj> odd </adj> but <adj> unique </adj>. it interrupted our conversation but i think that should be expected. the one or two items we selected were <adj> delicious </adj>!
the <adj> lamb </adj> dish was amazing. it did not have a <adj> wild </adj> flavor and tasted more like a <adj> pulled </adj> pork.
the beet concoction was insanely and quantifiably <adj> fabulous </adj>! just trust me.
