my <adj> fist </adj> time at canlis and i was so <adj> excited </adj> to try out this <adj> fancy </adj> restaurant. my boyfriend and i were celebrating our year and a <adj> half </adj> anniversary.

service was <adj> excellent </adj> and food was perfectly timed. waiting at the bar i had the <adj> red </adj> griffin, whew too <adj> sweet </adj>! 

now in the <adj> dining </adj> area, i ordered the 4 course which included 2 apps, <adj> main </adj> course, and dessert.

my oysters were <adj> delicious </adj>, however, peppercorns were too chunky in the mignonette and coarsely <adj> destroyed </adj> my palette. 

<adj> next </adj> was <adj> foie </adj> gras. i was so <adj> excited </adj> for this! however it was crafted as a moose, and was incredibly <adj> rich </adj> and not <adj> pleasant </adj>. served with <adj> sliced </adj> apples, layered with a thick apple chunk and all on a brioche cracker thing. i did not enjoy this at all. <adj> less </adj> is more, i'd rather it had been more <adj> balanced </adj> with some <adj> earthy </adj> greens to cut the heaviness of the moose. too <adj> sweet </adj> and too <adj> heavy </adj>. 

next was my <adj> main </adj> course, duck with squash! my duck was so so so <adj> tough </adj>. very <adj> disappointing </adj>. i chewed my way through because, well, i was <adj> hungry </adj>. 

dessert was banana moose. this was pretty <adj> good </adj>. didn't look pretty but, <adj> tasty </adj>. 

<adj> overall </adj> service was <adj> great </adj>! food, not so <adj> great </adj>. 

poorly balanced dishes (in my opinion of course!) i think everything was too <adj> heavy </adj>, too <adj> sweet </adj> and my duck died without being prepared well. <adj> poor </adj> duck. i needed a salt <adj> lick </adj> instead of an after dinner macaroon.
