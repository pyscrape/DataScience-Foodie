come here right when it opens which is around 6pm because it gets <adj> packed </adj> af super fast. there's not that <adj> many </adj> seats. 

service is <adj> super </adj> attentive- if you check into yelp you get a <adj> free </adj> beer!

got the truffle mac and cheese, ugly potato, some meat dish, and paella. the sizes are basically <adj> tapas </adj> style. i think what they are known for is the <adj> capri </adj> bag alcohol- there's a cube that lights up inside- novelty. the food is <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> rich </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj> (which i love). ordered 4 <adj> tapas </adj> plus 2 <adj> capri </adj> bags and the bill was about 90...so it is kind of on the <adj> pricey </adj> side.

giving it 4 stars because i like the novelty of the capri sun bags- quality of food wasn't <adj> bad </adj> but i don't think i would come back. it was a <adj> cool </adj> one time thing.
