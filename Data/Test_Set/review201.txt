when i heard about emmer & rye's dim sum <adj> cart </adj> service, i was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> apprehensive </adj>, fearing <adj> cultural </adj> misappropriation with a side of pretentiousness. my fears were <adj> unwarranted </adj> because the concept totally worked: the food was <adj> delicious </adj> (with one <adj> minor </adj> misstep of an overly salted pork shoulder), the waitstaff was <adj> knowledgeable </adj> yet not a bit <adj> snooty </adj>, and the <adj> overall </adj> meal experience was a standout in a sea of <adj> ever-increasing </adj> <adj> high-end </adj> dining options around town.

because the menu is always changing, i won't go into <adj> great </adj> detail about what we ordered with the exception of the cacio e pepe, a particularly <adj> well-executed </adj> version of this <adj> culinary </adj> darling, and the <adj> salted </adj> caramel panna cotta, which was paired with crunchy honeycomb and <adj> pecan </adj> granola for one amazing dessert. as far as quantity goes, our server recommended that two of us order <adj> 3-5 </adj> menu items, including the <adj> sweet </adj> course, to allow room for a <adj> few </adj> of the bites that made the rounds on the <adj> aforementioned </adj> dim sum carts. we ordered four dishes and only tried one dim sum because our <adj> small </adj> plates were surprisingly <adj> generous </adj> and filling.

a <adj> nice </adj> touch: for <adj> special </adj> occasions, they place a <adj> signed </adj> note card at your table to greet you upon arrival.
