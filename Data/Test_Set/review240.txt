one name: marco.

my friends took me here during my <adj> first </adj> night in seattle & advised how amazing the bar is.  they said, "tell marco what you like and he'll make you something <adj> delicious </adj>".  at <adj> first </adj> you might think they're exaggerating until you actually order with him.
while my request was fairly <adj> easy </adj> during my <adj> first </adj> visit- "jameson mule but not quite a mule".  he killed it in the <adj> best </adj> way possible.  my friend's request was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> more </adj> complicated- "vodka or rum based, <adj> little </adj> spicy, not too <adj> sweet </adj>, and has to be balanced".  he did just that!  the spicy drink was <adj> smooth </adj>, balanced, and had a <adj> nice </adj> kick at the end.  
after our <adj> first </adj> night, we decided to go back during lunch in hopes of seeing our <adj> beloved </adj> bartender there...he was not and the cocktails just didn't seem the <adj> same </adj> after.  but, i will say their <adj> small </adj> plates menu is <adj> decent </adj>.  the potatoes with <adj> garlic </adj> aioli had a crunchy exterior and <adj> soft </adj> interior.  just the way potatoes should be made.  <adj> cheese </adj> plate is <adj> good </adj> too, <adj> wish </adj> it came with <adj> toasted </adj> bread.
later that day <adj> same </adj> day, we returned in the evening because i knew marco would be there!  i told him to make me a <adj> chinese </adj> <adj> new </adj> year drink inspired by the year of the rooster, and it had to be <adj> red </adj> or gold in color.  since they didn't have rooster sauce (sriracha), he used tabasco.  i'm really not a <adj> huge </adj> fan of tabasco to begin with so i was thinking the hype of marco would die down... nope!  he, again, exceeded my expectation & mind was blown.

if it wasn't for him, i would probably give the establishment a 3 but because of his professionalism, liquor knowledge, and <adj> great </adj> service, it's a 5'er.
