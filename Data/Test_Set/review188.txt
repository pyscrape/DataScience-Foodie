man oh man! seattle has some <adj> great </adj> food. this by far was <adj> fave </adj>. i love carbs especially in pasta form. this place here is gold. the wait was surprisingly not that <adj> long </adj> maybe <adj> 15-20 </adj> mins. you order your <adj> own </adj> food and pay then find a seat and someone brings your plate out pretty quickly. so <adj> fast </adj> service. 

the menu was a <adj> little </adj> confusing but this was because we were expecting an <adj> actual </adj> menu with <adj> different </adj> types of pasta. luckily the super friendly cashier explained there was only 3 options for the day. 

i had what i think was the <adj> salsa </adj> verde pasta. it was thing pasta with some type of crumbs on top. <adj> holy </adj> baby jesus it was the <adj> best </adj> dang pasta i have ever tasted. i finished every bit of it and still wanted more.

my bf had the parpadelle a la bolangnes and his was really <adj> good </adj> too.

we both enjoyed our plates. i can't wait until the <adj> next </adj> time i'm in seattle to come back and try <adj> more </adj>.
