if you go here and have the homemade pasta, i dare you to write a review <adj> lower </adj> than 5 stars. you can't do it. it's too <adj> delicious </adj>. it's <adj> like </adj> pillows of heaven in your mouth. and i've been to italy. in fact, i lived there. in firenze, by the duomo in centro (that's for the naysayers). 

so, go find your friend who says "i should know because i know <adj> good </adj> <adj> italian </adj> food" when they're from like indiana or chicago or something and have never been to italy nor are <adj> italian </adj> (everyone has one of those friends eye roll), and take them here. and if they don't like it, then ask them if they like <adj> peanut </adj> butter or unicorns or puppies, because they probably don't. and you can unfriend them. in <adj> real </adj> life. cuz you don't need that kind of negativity. 

on a <adj> related </adj> note, the wine list is <adj> great </adj> too, as is the customer service. 10/10, would recommend.
