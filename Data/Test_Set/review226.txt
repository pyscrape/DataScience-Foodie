<adj> cute </adj> place with <adj> great </adj> service.  my <adj> well-cooked </adj> pasta carbonara was very <adj> rich </adj> with tons of <adj> small </adj> pancetta cubes.  eat it with a spoon; otherwise you'll have all pasta then all pancetta no matter how well you mix it. my wife's butternut squash ravioli was <adj> delicious </adj>, though you only get three <adj> big </adj> ones. unless the waiter ate one on his way to our table.  the bread to start came with butter instead of oil and vinegar.  as for the bruschetta... someone says the owner puts his love into the food... well, then he must hate the bruschetta's guts.  the bread is <adj> betty </adj> <adj> white </adj> in a desert dry (ours was a <adj> little </adj> burnt) with hardly a basil or <adj> garlic </adj> presence.  i wouldn't get it again.

returned a <adj> second </adj> time because the groupon deal is pretty <adj> amazing </adj>.  my meal was so <adj> good </adj> i bumped my review up a star from 3 to 4.  the pinotthe arancini di riso are riceballs that are more a <adj> hot </adj> cheesy goo than rice inside some <adj> fried </adj> balls, with <adj> meat </adj> sauce. the riceballs and amazeballs.  only two entrees were an <adj> additional </adj> $5, which was <adj> super </adj> rare.  because of this i got the most <adj> expensive </adj> dish, the <adj> farfalle </adj> ai crostacei (<adj> farfalle </adj> pasta, shrimp, <adj> lobster </adj> <adj> meat </adj> & crab <adj> meat </adj> sauteed with vodka, cream, <adj> louisana </adj> spices and marinara).  it appropriately has the initials f.a.c. because this <adj> rich </adj>, <adj> creamy </adj>, <adj> meat </adj> dish was facing <adj> great </adj>.
