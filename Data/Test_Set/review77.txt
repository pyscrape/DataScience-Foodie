came here to try their adult capri suns. <adj> i </adj> didn't get to try their food because we were <adj> short </adj> on time and there was already a <adj> long </adj> wait. we went by the bar and ordered a round of <adj> lyce </adj> reach <adj> rich </adj> which was soju, <adj> lyce </adj>, and mango. our drinks were served in plastic bags with <adj> led </adj> ice cubes. the drinks were <adj> delicious </adj> and <adj> strong </adj>. we also tried the pure jeremy which was soju, muddled strawberries, and yuzu. both tasted <adj> good </adj> and couldn't tell there was 20% alcohol inside. <adj> i </adj> saw them washing and hanging the plastic bags so <adj> i </adj> believe they reuse them..can't comment on the food, but the drinks are <adj> yummy </adj>. also the bar is cash only!
