i missed a friend's hh get together a <adj> few </adj> months ago, so when a <adj> few </adj> of my <adj> grad </adj> school friends decided to have a get together for the <adj> new </adj> year, i suggested this place as i really want to try it.

i loved the atmosphere as soon as i walked in. it had a <adj> cozy </adj> decor but also elegant at the <adj> same </adj> time. we got a table towards the back and i loved the <adj> comfortable </adj> cushiony <adj> high </adj> <adj> top </adj> chairs. the walls also have a lot of plates decoration. 

the drink menu makes you want to literally try everything! <adj> i </adj> settled for freddy's mule which had vodka, apple liqueur, lime, and <adj> ginger </adj> beer. yum. it was so <adj> good </adj> that after the <adj> first </adj> round, everyone in my party decided to get my drink. the food is definitely better than your <adj> average </adj> bar food which is a blessing! the <adj> only </adj> thing that wasn't as <adj> great </adj> was the <adj> vegetable </adj> dumplings. otherwise, the brisket slider was to die for! the waitress had recommended that and she is so <adj> right </adj>! we also got the buffalo spring rolls. it wasn't <adj> bad </adj> but there was this <adj> weird </adj> taste. maybe it had some sort of cheese in the spring rolls. not <adj> sure </adj>. we also got two kinds of flatbread. they were both <adj> yummy </adj>! <adj> i </adj> loved the arugula flatbread. so <adj> good </adj>. honestly, <adj> i </adj> wish we tried <adj> more </adj> things on the menu. they were that <adj> good </adj>. 

throughout the night, everyone was so <adj> happy </adj> with the drinks and food and that i recommended an <adj> awesome </adj> spot. now i am <adj> responsible </adj> for picking out the <adj> next </adj> spot for another get together. dutch fred's will be <adj> hard </adj> to top.
