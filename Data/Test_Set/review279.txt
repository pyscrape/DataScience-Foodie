the service here was amazing! their dumplings were also <adj> good </adj>. this is not a <adj> great </adj> place to bring a group as the space is <adj> small </adj> but a <adj> great </adj> place to have a <adj> casual </adj> lunch with a friend or by yourself. it has a <adj> nice </adj> laid back and family feel. my <adj> entree </adj> meal was the <adj> fried </adj> chicken, which could've been better. tasted like it was burned on some sides. however, i will be back to try their <adj> other </adj> options.

also, their <adj> lemon </adj> honey iced tea is the bomb.
