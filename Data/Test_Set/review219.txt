emmer and rye was sent from heaven by angels to give us peasants the <adj> best </adj> meal of our lives.  this place is it.

during a weekend trip to beautiful austin, my friend and i made a reservation at emmer.  we were offered seats at the chefs table and i'm so <adj> glad </adj> we took them.  the <adj> well-oiled </adj> machine that comprises the emmer experience is fascinating and friendly. 

oh the food...the food heart eye emoji.  i'm convinced you can't go <adj> wrong </adj> with anything on the menu.  we ordered a bunch of <adj> small </adj> dishes, including the pork belly, burratta, and some kind of cheesy pasta that was to die for.  everything was just <adj> delectable </adj>!  

honestly, i would fly to austin just for another meal at emmer and rye.  it was that <adj> good </adj>.
