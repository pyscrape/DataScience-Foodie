canlis is a <adj> world-class </adj> premium dining experience from start to finish, and an absolute must whenever you want to impress somebody, celebrate an <adj> important </adj> event, or just have a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> romantic </adj> night out. the food was <adj> great </adj> but what really <adj> blew </adj> my mind was the <adj> logistical </adj> precision with which the staff made <adj> sure </adj> that we were always taken care of and <adj> happy </adj>. throughout the evening, the <adj> total </adj> time we spent waiting with nothing to do, drink, or eat, added up cumulatively, must have been <adj> less </adj> than 45 seconds. honestly the experience runs with the <adj> obsessive </adj> perfection of a <adj> swiss </adj> watch.

the restaurant is <adj> easy </adj> to find, right on aurora avenue just south of the lake union bridge and well marked. we pulled up to the <adj> front </adj> door and valets rushed out to grab my car. no ticket needed: they remember you based on the name on your reservation. canlis has a dress code and you'll want to go more <adj> formal </adj> with your <adj> attire </adj> here: if you're going by <adj> traditional </adj> dress code etiquette, use the <adj> dressy </adj> <adj> casual </adj> code at a minimum (i.e., jackets and dress shirt for men, dresses, skirts, or <adj> dressy </adj> pants outfits for women), or go more <adj> formal </adj> if you wish. i saw <adj> attire </adj> ranging from <adj> dressy </adj> <adj> casual </adj> to <adj> black </adj> tie.

a host immediately greeted us as we walked in the <adj> front </adj> door and gave our names. we were seated immediately, near the <adj> large </adj> plate glass wraparound windows and with a <adj> spectacular </adj>, sparkling view to the east of lake union and capitol hill. our server, summer, came to greet us within one minute and she was <adj> great </adj> the <adj> whole </adj> meal. she and the rest of the staff made <adj> sure </adj> our water glasses were never <adj> more </adj> than half <adj> empty </adj>, our drinks always <adj> full </adj>, and food always either in <adj> front </adj> of us or on the way. she was expert on the <adj> nitty </adj> <adj> gritty </adj> details of all the cocktails, wines, and food options that we asked about, had <adj> well-reasoned </adj> recommendations, and was friendly and <adj> professional </adj>.

with a glass of syrah in hand, i went for the <adj> four-course </adj> option. it's really more like a <adj> 7-course </adj> meal, as in between each of the courses they bring you a <adj> little </adj> <adj> side </adj> dish to nibble on. with so much food to try, i won't rehash it all here, but i will say that it was all <adj> delicious </adj>, perfectly cooked, and <adj> well-worth </adj> the price. my <adj> favorite </adj> highlights of the meal included a <adj> fried </adj> buratta appetizer, cabbage pierre, <adj> wagyu </adj> <adj> new </adj> york strip steak, and an <adj> in-between-courses </adj> loaf of <adj> freshly </adj> baked saltwater sourdough bread.

as a <adj> nifty </adj> <adj> little </adj> <adj> going-away </adj> present, the valets already had my car idling and <adj> ready </adj> by the front door when we walked out. a <adj> great </adj> end to a <adj> great </adj> evening. canlis has earned my trust and admiration, and i can't wait to come back here again!
