as soon as i walked in to get my nails polished, i realized i had made a <adj> bad </adj> mistake and this place was probably <adj> more </adj> of a restaurant than the salon i was looking for. never one to turn away from a <adj> good </adj> adventure, i sat down anyway to try out some food. the <adj> previous </adj> sentences are not <adj> true </adj>, besides sitting down to try out some food, fyi.

we started with two appetizers: goulash soup, which was <adj> tiny </adj> but also <adj> excellent </adj>, and pirogues (sp?) which were <adj> delicious </adj> and if you've ever had <adj> fake </adj> pirogues, this is what they're actually supposed to taste like apparently. <adj> high </adj> recommendations.

then we got the goulash for dinner and it was <adj> awesome </adj> and i also said "hearty" about 40 times. it was <adj> delightful </adj>. filling food is <adj> good </adj> food, and those <adj> eastern </adj> europeans know how to keep themselves filled. we also got the <adj> polish </adj> specialty plate, which had everything i never knew i wanted to try and was <adj> fantastic </adj>.

if you want to get your nails polished, stay away. if you want to get your <adj> polish </adj> food, go here!
