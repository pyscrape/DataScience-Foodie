wow, i can't even describe how <adj> good </adj> this place is. we had a group of 9 and the service was just as <adj> stellar </adj> as the food.

we ordered a <adj> little </adj> bit of everything from fish, steak (<adj> holy </adj> cow amazing), <adj> stuffed </adj> rice dumplings, and still left a bit of space for dessert. starting with the appetizers, we had a <adj> sublime </adj> egg and <adj> stuffed </adj> dumpling. i've never had something so <adj> creamy </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>.

seriously one of the <adj> best </adj> experiences i've had. the waiter was <adj> super </adj> quick and answered all our questions about the food. she was <adj> patient </adj> and was very <adj> happy </adj> to explain all the dishes.

a <adj> best </adj> in austin, would recommend for anyone.
