we wanted to drive in the city for a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> italian </adj> dinner date, my husband and  i. and  i came across this spot,  i'm a <adj> picky </adj> eater so  i  chose this out of a <adj> few </adj> other options. 

what won me over was the fact they have <adj> happy </adj> hour all day! only on the food list, not the "<adj> featured </adj> dishes." 

we walked in, the ambience looked so lovely, intimate, and sweet. it's <adj> perfect </adj> for date night or a <adj> nice </adj> night out with friends. the people knew i was deaf because i obviously was signing, the bartender was so <adj> attentive </adj> and <adj> nice </adj>. 
the waiter was so <adj> sweet </adj>!  i  loved her style, too <adj> bad </adj>  i  never got her name. the staff was so <adj> nice </adj>, we sat at the bar for a bit and when one of the tables cleared up, they sat us down at the table immediately. they even carried our drinks over! <adj> great </adj> staff. 


we ordered four <adj> different </adj> dishes, like the <adj> grilled </adj> octopus salad with citrus emulsion. 
 i  have to say, that was the <adj> best </adj> octopus i've ever had.  i'm a fan of octopus and this was cooked perfectly! it was <adj> great </adj> to share with my husband too, you will not regret this order. 

<adj> top </adj> sirloin  steak  with <adj> feta </adj> riccola salad, that was so <adj> good </adj>. i loved loved this. i only <adj> wish </adj> they had more steak but that's okay, it was seriously the bomb dotcom. the  feta  cheese was amazing too, the salad... yum. 

my husband ordered the gnocchi rose and he loved it. i'm not a fan of gnocchi in <adj> general </adj>, but the taste was <adj> delicious </adj>. 

he also ordered the mussels with bread, the broth was amazing. the waiter even came back and asked us if we wanted <adj> complimentary </adj> bread to dip the broth in. i was like  yes  please. <adj> needless </adj> to say, we definitely swallowed up every bit of our four meals. 

come for <adj> happy </adj> hour! the trip from bothell was so worth it. 

next time  i 'm visiting seattle,  i'll definitely come back here and  i highly recommend this to anyone who is visiting from out of town or even any seattle local!
