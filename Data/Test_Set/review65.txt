i really enjoyed this experience!

<adj> korean </adj> bbq tapas. we shared four.

the <<adj> adj </adj>> first </<adj> adj </adj>> to arrive was a <<adj> adj </adj>> korean </<adj> adj </adj>> seafood pancake which was <<adj> adj </adj>> <adj> delicious </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>>. highly <adj> recommended </adj>. it comes with a <adj> little </adj> <adj> au </adj> jus that adds a <adj> perfect </adj> <adj> additional </adj> bit of saltiness and <adj> mild </adj> heat.

the <adj> next </adj> was their crispy chicken in a <adj> sweet </adj> and spicy sauce and <adj> black </adj> sesame crumbles. also <adj> delicious </adj> and also highly recommended.

<adj> third </adj>, we had the "<adj> kimchi </adj> paellea". it looks like paella but with the <adj> creamiest </adj> rice at the base. <adj> i </adj> enjoyed it, but it didn't do it for me. hey, listen, <adj> i </adj> was <adj> plenty </adj> <adj> happy </adj> already.

<adj> fourth </adj>, we had a <adj> tofu </adj> chili. it was interesting. it came with <adj> nacho </adj> chips.  i can't say it was my type of dish, but i enjoyed having tasted it.

the service was <<adj> adj </adj>> awesome </<adj> adj </adj>>. aside from being <adj> polite </adj> and <adj> attentive </adj> in the <adj> normal </adj> course, they made <adj> sure </adj> to present each dish so nicely and with <adj> such </adj> passion that it added to the experience immensely. with each dish was a <adj> further </adj> description of what it was, how it was made, whether there was a <adj> particular </adj> way it was recommend to eat it, what the sauce that they brought would serve to do to the flavor, etc.  i really appreciate that kind of presentation that really looks to maximize the patrons' enjoyment of the meal.

lastly, we had dessert. it was "<adj> popcorn </adj> ice cream" with a <adj> salted </adj> caramel sauce. it was <adj> tasty </adj> and <adj> indulgent </adj>, though rather <adj> basic </adj> at its root. the portion could've been a <adj> tiny </adj> bit <adj> larger </adj> for $9...<adj> i </adj> mean, it's <adj> vanilla </adj> ice cream and <adj> popcorn </adj>.  that <adj> commentary </adj> about the desert certainly doesn't upend all that was awesome about this meal.

oh, and we can end on a <adj> high </adj> note. the drinks - <adj> many </adj> of which are served in <adj> capri-sun-style </adj> bags with <adj> light </adj> up ice cubes in them - were also really <adj> tasty </adj>. <adj> i </adj> had a mango lychee one with soju (20% alcohol) and <adj> i </adj>'d happily do it again.

i will definitely return.
