the <adj> first </adj> time <adj> i </adj> wanted to stop in was on a saturday and the line was out the door.  <adj> i </adj> stopped back on a wednesday about 3:30 pm and the place was still very <adj> busy </adj> but <adj> i </adj> found a table.  lunch menu is <adj> dirt </adj> cheap at $10.50.  <adj> i </adj> had the pickle soup (<adj> chicken </adj> stock with veggies - ok but <adj> different </adj>) and a breaded pork cutlet which was very <adj> nice </adj>. <adj> i </adj> was a <adj> happy </adj> camper.

kind of <adj> old </adj> fashioned but the place works for me.
