we came in for dinner on <adj> friday </adj> night to find the restaurant completely filled. luckily, there was a <adj> short </adj> wait, so we started off at the bar. i had a hofbrau dunkel and then a grzaniec - a <adj> polish </adj> mulled beer with honey and cinnamon. i'd recommend trying the grzaniec.

we started with the <adj> white </adj> borscht. it was the <adj> perfect </adj> warmer on a <adj> cold </adj> night. the soup is served in a bread bowl which makes the <adj> dish </adj> very filling. it's definitely <adj> ideal </adj> to share it.

for the <adj> main </adj> course, we shared the <adj> polish </adj> platter which had pierogies, kielbasa, latkes, and <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage. the platter is a <adj> great </adj> way to sample several <adj> polish </adj> specialities. 

all in all, it's a <adj> great </adj> restaurant for both <adj> small </adj> and <adj> large </adj> groups. the atmosphere was lively, and the staff was <adj> attentive </adj>.
