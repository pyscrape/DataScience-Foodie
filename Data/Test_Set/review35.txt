the <adj> best </adj> <adj> old </adj> fashioned i've ever had.

the absolute <adj> best </adj> service i've ever had at a restaurant. i have eaten at a lot of <adj> nice </adj> restaurants, but canlis put <adj> most </adj> all of them to shame. the service alone makes this review 5 stars.

the <adj> second </adj> <adj> best </adj> view from any <adj> seattle </adj> restaurant (the <adj> best </adj> being atop the space needle).

after having the <adj> full </adj> course menu (which was <adj> spectacular </adj>) is to skip the <adj> full </adj> wine pairing (which we each also had, and didn't really enjoy). the wine pairings were almost too much for me, and were way too much for my wife. if you're stuck on getting the wine pairings (and you really like both <adj> red </adj> and <adj> white </adj> wines), i strongly suggest considering sharing the flight. i'm very <adj> glad </adj> we took an <adj> uber </adj> to and from. the amount of alcohol we consumed tamped down a bit on our delight of the food.

seattle has so <adj> many </adj> <adj> wonderful </adj> restaurants with some of the <adj> best </adj> food i've ever had anywhere, but canlis distinguishes itself with service, class, and atmosphere. i've had food just as <adj> good </adj> elsewhere in town, but nowhere else puts it all together like this.

canlis also distinguishes itself with the price. this was our <adj> 20th </adj> <adj> anniversary </adj> dinner, so we didn't hold back at all, and it ended up being, by far, and i mean by far, the single most <adj> expensive </adj> dining experience the two of us have ever had. canlis should have 6 of those $'s that yelp uses. that said, i don't regret it at all.
