the <adj> best </adj> <adj> old </adj> fashioned i've ever had.

the absolute <adj> best </adj> service i've ever had at a restaurant. i have eaten at a lot of <adj> nice </adj> restaurants, but canlis put <adj> most </adj> all of them to shame. the service alone makes this review 5 stars.

the <adj> second </adj> <adj> best </adj> view from any <adj> seattle </adj> restaurant (the <adj> best </adj> being atop the space needle).

after having the <adj> full </adj> course menu (which was <adj> spectacular </adj>) is to skip the <adj> full </adj> <adj> wine </adj> pairing (which we each also had, and didn't really enjoy). the <adj> wine </adj> pairings were almost too <adj> much </adj> for me, and were way too <adj> much </adj> for my wife. if you're stuck on getting the <adj> wine </adj> pairings (and you really like both <adj> red </adj> and <adj> white </adj> wines), <adj> i </adj> strongly suggest considering sharing the flight. <adj> i </adj>'m very <adj> glad </adj> we took an <adj> uber </adj> to and from. the amount of alcohol we consumed tamped down a bit on our delight of the food.

seattle has so <adj> many </adj> <adj> wonderful </adj> restaurants with some of the <adj> best </adj> food i've ever had anywhere, but canlis distinguishes itself with service, class, and atmosphere. i've had food just as <adj> good </adj> elsewhere in town, but nowhere else puts it all together like this.

canlis also distinguishes itself with the price. this was our <adj> 20th </adj> <adj> anniversary </adj> dinner, so we didn't hold back at all, and it ended up being, by far, and <adj> i </adj> mean by far, the <adj> single </adj> most <adj> expensive </adj> dining experience the two of us have ever had. canlis should have 6 of those $'s that yelp uses. that said, <adj> i </adj> don't regret it at all.
