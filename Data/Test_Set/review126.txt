yumm...

this place is my girlfriend and i's use to be raving <adj> happy </adj> hour spot, haven't gone in a while due to the distance from our home. the service there is hit or <adj> miss </adj> depending on who you get. one of our waitress was always <adj> attentive </adj> and always poured us wine <adj> everytime </adj> she passed by. the other waitress, on the other hand was a bit stand off <adj> ish </adj> and wasn't <adj> personable </adj>.

the food - we like the seabass, gnocchi was very <adj> rich </adj> and <adj> creamy </adj> - but like pillows in your mouth. we also enjoyed their <adj> grilled </adj> ceasar salad - a bit <adj> weird </adj> at <adj> first </adj> bite because it is cooked lettuce, but the <adj> grill </adj> taste does not disappoint. all in all, we enjoy our visit to list.
