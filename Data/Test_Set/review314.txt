i took one of my <adj> best </adj> friends out to dinner here for her birthday <adj> last </adj> weekend. it was <adj> perfect </adj>! this place is such a <adj> cute </adj> <adj> little </adj> "<adj> french </adj> tapas bar." it is a <adj> chic </adj>, cozy, <adj> tight </adj>, <adj> artsy </adj> environment with <adj> good </adj> drinks & interesting <adj> small </adj> plates of <adj> french </adj> food. it is on the <adj> pricier </adj> side but definitely well worth it. <adj> great </adj> <adj> friendly </adj> service. no reservations, walk ins only. we lucked out and got a table for 2 in the back, whereas the majority of the restaurant is seated at the bar. i would definitely recommend for an intimate outing, catching up with a friend, out for a <adj> special </adj> occasion, or just out with a <adj> couple </adj> girlfriends :)
