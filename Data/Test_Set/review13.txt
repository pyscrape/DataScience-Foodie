brand <adj> new </adj> to the austin food truck scene, dee dee offers a selection of <adj> north </adj> thai street food that's truly <adj> authentic </adj> and possibly <adj> addictive </adj>.  tucked in the back of the <adj> same </adj> lot as la barbecue, owners justin and lakana are selling some seriously <adj> tasty </adj> home cooking.  i decided to try all three of their <adj> savory </adj> offerings and came away <adj> impressed </adj>.  

their pork skewers (moo ping) were <adj> amazing </adj>, marinated to perfection and freshly grilled.  while there was <adj> enough </adj> flavor just in the meat itself, it came with a <adj> small </adj> container of spicy fish sauce for dipping.  loved their fish sauce as it was also a <adj> great </adj> accompaniment to the side of <adj> sticky </adj> rice.

the larb moo and pad kra pow were also equally <adj> delicious </adj> and both featured  <adj> more </adj> well <adj> seasoned </adj> pork.  the <adj> first </adj> is served with <adj> sticky </adj> rice while the <adj> latter </adj> comes with <adj> jasmine </adj> rice and fried egg.  i can assure you both were devoured in record time... just too <adj> good </adj> not to be.

do yourself a favor the <adj> next </adj> time you're in the area and skip the bbq line to give dee dee a try.  you'll be <adj> glad </adj> you did.
