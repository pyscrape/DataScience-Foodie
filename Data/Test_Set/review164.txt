i came here for the chef's tasting menu. it was a <adj> crazy </adj> experience, one that i will never forget. 

every dish was made very delicately, and every flavor was calculated and <adj> precise </adj>. every plate i tasted felt so <adj> right </adj> and so <adj> perfect </adj>. the service is also <adj> great </adj>. the workers are very <adj> attentive </adj> and really know how to take care of you. the restaurant itself was <adj> smaller </adj> than i thought it was, so you should probably make a reservation before coming if <adj> possible </adj>. parking was also <adj> scarce </adj>, but <adj> other </adj> than that, two thumbs up. i'll be back to try out their <adj> regular </adj> dinner menu.
