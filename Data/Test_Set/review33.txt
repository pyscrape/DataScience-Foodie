i have been here before but my <adj> east </adj> coast buddy had one night in seattle and had never been. i kind of figured it was gonna be <adj> lackluster </adj> having been before but...

<adj> impeccable </adj> service and food. if you ask for a tour they'll take you after dessert (make <adj> sure </adj> to tip :-))

recommend the 9pm seating. you'll get the window you requested and feel like the only ones there. 

renewed respect. you're no <adj> longer </adj> that place i'm supposed to like.
