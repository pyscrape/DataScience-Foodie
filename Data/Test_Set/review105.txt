a yelp map search find!
i  took the husband to see the tree and as we were walking around we wanted a <adj> nice </adj> place to have a drink.   not a beer, but a well made cocktail.  so  i did a yelp map search for cocktail and found dutch freds was close  by. ok, truth is we were lured in by the two $$.  i should have known that $$ means $$$ as our drinks were $14 each.  we didn't mind paying though due to the quality of the food and drink.  my husband ordered the "<adj> working </adj> man" $14 and is amazing! it comes in a bottle filled with the <adj> mixed </adj> drink and sealed with smoke, wait a moment then pour over an ice ball.  it was so <adj> good </adj> we both had a <adj> second </adj> one.
the deviled eggs $14 for 3! <adj> delicious </adj> but a bit too <adj> pricey </adj>.  
this was a <adj> cool </adj> spot and loved the drinks and service was above and beyond <adj> good </adj>.
