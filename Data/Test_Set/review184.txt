although their pasta is <adj> delicious </adj>, i don't quite think they live up to 5-stars like everyone else. bummer. 

so <adj> first </adj> and foremost, only being <adj> open </adj> for lunch during the weekdays sucks for us! we've been in <adj> seattle </adj> 2 years and today was our <adj> first </adj> visit because the times don't work for us. also, you're in downtown, no parking, yada yada yada. there's a garage at the corner of yesler for $6 for 2 hours (you'll need 2) so save yourself some time and just go there. 

the line was out the door when we arrived at 1pm. and just a heads up, the line stretches the <adj> whole </adj> way inside, so you're not even close when you think you are inside. we waited a total of about 40 minutes. the etiquette is to seat yourself after you order, and then bus your <adj> own </adj> table. i absolutely hate the system. <adj> most </adj> of the crowd we saw ended up sharing tables with other parties. that's just not my thing. i like space and privacy when i'm having food out. then the staff are shouting your name and carrying your food through the crowd. it's just a mess in my opinion. 

the menu had 3 pasta options. 2 of them had meat and one was <adj> vegetarian </adj>, so if you are <adj> vegetarian </adj>, your choice is definitely limited here. 

the pasta itself is <adj> perfect </adj>! it's a <adj> delicious </adj> al dente covered in just the <adj> right </adj> amount of sauce. i had the celeriac and leek, which was insanely <adj> delicious </adj>. i have no doubt that any dish you pick will be amazing. they are about $10 per dish, and it's a <adj> decent </adj> portion size. <adj> most </adj> people i saw finished their bowl, but it wasn't too much that you need a <adj> nap </adj> afterwards. 

the focaccia was <adj> moist </adj> and a <adj> good </adj> addition to share with the table. i also enjoyed the kale salad, which was lightly dressed (just like i like it!) and a <adj> nice </adj> portion size for the price. it could easily be shared. 

our lunch for 2 was about $35- <adj> decent </adj> price. staff at the front taking orders were friendly. the place itself seems <adj> clean </adj> and i saw staff wiping down tables after guests left. 

i just don't think i'll be back based on the wait time. i don't like waiting in a line watching people eat for almost an hour. and then i felt kinda rushed to eat quickly once we got our food. 45ish <adj> minute </adj> wait in line. 10 <adj> minute </adj> wait for food. 10 minutes to eat. now get out. not my thing. 

if you have patience, i recommend trying them. if you don't like crowds, then this probably won't be your <adj> favorite </adj> pasta place. 

food- 5 stars
ambience- 2 stars

i have to give 4 stars based on the <adj> limited </adj> menu, wait times, opening times, and ambience.
