when you are featured on <adj> high </adj> profile food websites such as eater, you know that you are going to garner a lot of attention. such is the situation for <adj> ll </adj> corvo pasta.

<adj> ll </adj> corvo pasta is a very <adj> small </adj>, and i mean very <adj> small </adj>, <adj> italian </adj> restaurant in <adj> downtown </adj> seattle. it is located on a slope with a view of the water. i'm not <adj> sure </adj> if this was always the case, but you are going to be waiting a <adj> long </adj> time for a meal at <adj> ll </adj> corvo. the restaurant is only <adj> open </adj> for lunch and rightfully so because they'<adj> ll </adj> be booked all day if they were <adj> open </adj> <adj> longer </adj>. 

i'm <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> sure </adj> the <adj> ultimate </adj> appeal about this restaurant is that it sells <adj> high </adj> quality pasta at <adj> smaller </adj>, <adj> lunch </adj> sized portions for $9. yes, that's <adj> right </adj>. <adj> good </adj> pasta for nine dollars. since this place opens at 11, this means come at 11am and not at noon. otherwise you won't get in for <adj> more </adj> than an hour and you'll be waiting on that fun slope.

when you do get in you will notice that the menu is very <adj> simplistic </adj>. there are generally only 3 pasta items that rotate as well as <adj> usual </adj> appetizers such as a kale salad, <adj> focaccia </adj> bread, and a number of sparkling drinks. i ended up getting a pasta which i unfortunately forgot the name of.. it was "<adj> matisa </adj> milk with feta..." it had no meat in it but it seemed like a <adj> popular </adj> choice and so i got it with <adj> focaccia </adj> bread. 

at this restaurant you don't get a number, you just wait in line, order, and then sit down. the food will be brought to you and then you bus it later. after i ordered, i was quickly brought my bread. damn, for only $3, this <adj> focaccia </adj> bread was amazing! i'd give it 10/10.

my pasta soon came out and i have to say it was pretty damn <adj> good </adj>. for the price, you do get a pretty <adj> small </adj> plate of pasta but the quality definitely overweighs the quantity. i was definitely <adj> full </adj> with the bread and loved how <adj> creamy </adj> my pasta was. i'd give it 9/10.

so, was the wait worth it? with the bread and the pasta, and the <adj> overall </adj> cost of the lunch. i'd say yes! but <adj> next </adj> come, definitely check out <adj> ll </adj> corvo when it opens immediately. otherwise, anything will taste <adj> good </adj> to you. 

eat well and prosper,
