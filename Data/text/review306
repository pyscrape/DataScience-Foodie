One of my favourites from my NY trip. A cute, vintagey little bar, with a few tables and bar seating. We visited initially for Happy Hour, which was 241 on certain wines or beers or Royales. I made my way through all the Royales- think Kir, hibiscus, lavender, rose etc. They were floral without being over sweet and had plenty of crisp prosecco. 

We had dinner plans but we loved the look of the French small plates and classic cocktails so we headed back a couple of times. The small plates were great for picking at while drinking their fabulous cocktails. The duck confit parmentier was rich and beautiful. Scallop carpaccio was a little oily but really fresh tasting.

We made our way through a few cocktails too, so good to see my favourite Aviation on there! The atmosphere is lovely, the staff are friendly and the drinks are beautiful. Go!
