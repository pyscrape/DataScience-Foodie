WOW.
I love this place. Right away the customer service was <adj> friendly </adj> and kept blowing me away the longer I was there. An employee, I think he said his name may have been Michael (?), asked for my and my friend's names and offered us samples. <adj> Super helpful </adj>, <adj> patient </adj> , and <adj> kind </adj>. I tried the spicy version of their salmon, tuna, and tako (octopus). It was all so good I ended up ordering their customized poke bowl "Fi-Yah" that comes with those 3. They have all sorts of poke variety (sweet, spicy, standard; tuna, salmon, tako) and I was surprised to see the tako option. One of those rare restaurants where the variety did not diminish quality. Oh and they offered my friend and I miso soup on the house! We of course welcomed that on a rainy day.

They have an option to upgrade your size for $5, so I did that since I was planning on sharing it with someone later. It was HUGE. I was so pleased with the layers of poke scoops they gave me (especially since king size ended up being $20).

Most of their toppings are pretty standard to many poke places, but they did have spicy crab salad which was cool and different. Everything was <adj> delicious </adj>.

 Lastly, the decoration and vibe in there was bright and warm! It really reminded me of being in Hawaii despite that it was raining and cloudy right outside. 

Poke has been popping up all over now (yay!) and this restaurant definitely stands out in all categories: food, atmosphere, and service.
