First time here in Seattle, found this spot on Yelp and thought to give it a try. Great find! Romantic/hip ambiance with the lighting. It really is a small cozy spot with a bar adjacent to dining. I wouldn't go there with more than 4 people max! There are no reservations. We got there and they were packed. Grabbed drinks at the bar until a table opened up in about 30 minutes. The drinks were OK(didn't order anything fancy), bartender very friendly. 

The food was fabulous! I couldn't believe how tasty the food was and the portions for that inexpensive price. We got 3 dishes to share between 2 and it was perfect. Started with the seabass, crispy outside and buttery center on Kale chips and some spicy rice I think. Next was the Rose Gnocchi which was seasoned with a creamy pink peppery sauce. Lastly we got the 5oz steak with a side salad that was again very tasty. I usually eat my meat medium rare but my boyfriend likes it well done. I would definitely get it medium rare next time. 

Overall great food for great price!
