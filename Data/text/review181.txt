The food is superb, and - nobody goes here any more, it's too crowded!

Of course, people come here, in droves. I suggest coming before 11:30. My friend was late so I got to watch a weekday parade of diners come through between 11:45 and 12:15 when my friend finally arrived - I have seen that you *can* get a seat; it's easier if there's two of you.

And, the reason why is that the food is superb. End of story. The pasta is - the best ever. OK, maybe there's the great Roman place you remember (it wasn't in Campo di Fiori, that's for sure) or what have you, but as far as Seattle is concerned, it's The Best Ever. There's no contest. Il Corvo is The Pasta Champion.

This is an awesome moment in Seattle culinary history. It's kind of a pain to pay $4/hr to park three blocks away and then wait in a line that moves slowly and then rushes forward and then stops again . . . and then you sit down and you realize that you have never ever not even one time had pasta this good - and if by some miracle you did, then you thank The Stars Above that you got one more chance again.

The future is uncertain. Get her as quickly as you can. Come back as often as you can. And - let me put it this way: thanks to Marcella Hazan, you can make a great Bolognese at home, but you can't come anywhere near this pasta. Nobody can. Get in here, while the getting's good!
