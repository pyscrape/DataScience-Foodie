3.5 but Yelp doesn't offer half stars so it's a 4. 

I recommend coming in for happy hour. Discount success for good food and refreshing drinks. Love that their drafts are local. Ordered a black currant lavender hard cider from the Olympic peninsula. Delicious!

We ordered potatoes bravas, bread salad, Boar meatballs, and Taylor shellfish oysters.  Grateful for the variety of dishes they serve, but reminder you're going to need to order a lot to have a full meal. 

Their wild boar Meatballs in mole sauce makes life delightful. And the oysters, you can't go wrong with Taylor shellfish company! Instant Gratification from the refreshing salad, but the bread in it was off putting (I should have known better).

All in all, It's a great place to meet up and enjoy a quick or long happy hour. Love their infused waters! Way to go!
