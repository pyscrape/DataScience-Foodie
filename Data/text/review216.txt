We had a really great time here last night. Very, very interesting cocktail menu. I'll go back to the bar just to have the following drink at the end of a hard work day: El Cuado: which is Mescal, Amaro Montenegro, Aperol, Lemon

They have a really interesting and modern decor. It's a fun looking bar area. We sat down for dinner and enjoyed most every single dish. It was all very inventive and creative. There are a few dishes that we might've found to be a 4 instead of a 5, but most of it was a 5. And food is really subjective so it's hard to take away any stars just because there were a few dishes that we thought were above average instead of stellar. And when you factor in service, drink selection, decor and the food, the places Is an overall 5 for sure. We will be back.
