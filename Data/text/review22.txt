I'm new to Seattle and everyone seems to answer "Canlis" when I ask "what's the best foodie restaurant in Seattle". I reserved a table for two for my birthday and opted for the four course menu, rather than the 9 course tasting menu. I also chose the classic wine pairing.  

Unfortunately, there wasn't much about the experience that met my expectations, and nothing that exceeded them. 

The staff were friendly and accommodating, although our  server seemed not to know the menu and wines well. Generally, we struggled to understand one another. I was hoping for more guidance with both food and wine choices, to maximize the experience. 

I thought the food was what one might expect at a casual dining restaurant. There was nothing extraordinary about any of our courses - they were mostly good.  I was disappointed by my main course,  "pork with radicchio, apple, fennel, and a sauce of drippings and black garlic".  Everything on the plate was beige - completely void of color - and the pork under-cooked. No exaggeration. 

I enjoyed the Spot Prawns and Sweet Onions (presentation on the latter was lovely) but these were both very small tasting portions. I also had the Steak Tartare which was, in my opinion, heavy-handed. I am accustomed to this dish being delicate. The beef seemed as though it were ground rather than thin shaved. This dish was all red - garnish and all, no variation in color, save for a dollop of what I think was called an egg 'puree'. 

The view from our table was great, looking out over Lake Union, but the restaurant itself was bland, also void of color. White table clothes all over adorned with nothing charming or visually appealing. It felt as though there were a 'no color' rule at Canlis. 

All in all, I was expecting an extraordinary meal and experience but didn't receive either.  The check came to $366 for two people, including the 20% mandatory tip. 

I'm glad to have tried Canlis but am disappointed I didn't put nearly $400 to better use.
