Awesome place to get Polish food!! The decor is in the theme of a log cabin, which is really cozy. They have a large selection of wine and beer. The pierogies are a must to try! 

My only complaint is that the waitresses all seemed to be in a constant hurry the entire time we were there. This was in spite of the fact that less than half of the tables were occupied. I'm not sure if this is common, or if we just happened to have come at a particularly bad time. Nevertheless, the food is worth the visit!
