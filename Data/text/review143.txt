Looks like Second Bar + Kitchen is the place to be for dinner.  While their menu was great, loved the dessert wine that was suggested by our waitress, and even the small tapas was the right portions, my braised beef short rib served with truffle grits, caramelized onions and brandy balsamic glaze was way too salty for my liking.  I was also disappointed that my grits was cold by the time it came to our table. It made the taste very fattening and greasy.  In addition, when I requested to order an espresso, I was later told that their barista had shut down and to make even a cup of coffee was out of the question. Oh well... such as life!!  Service however was nice, and dinning outdoor facing the sidewalk wasn't too bad.

Cheers!
