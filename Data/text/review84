Delicious. 

I stumbled upon this tiny spot that ended up serving me the best poke bowl I've had in the city. 

We tasted their salmon poke bowl and their ahi tuna poke bowl, and they were both phenomenal (and filling). Fresh ingredients, mouthwatering fish, and plenty of tasty rice on the bottom (we opted for brown rice). 

The service is personable and welcoming. It's a tiny place, so not many seats. However, turnover is fast. 

Truly highly recommended.
