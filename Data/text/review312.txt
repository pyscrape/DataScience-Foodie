I love this place. I came here with a girlfriend to get a few drinks. We ordered the cheese platter. The cocktails are very interesting and there are different choices. The ingredients in the cocktails are what made the prices worth it. The mix of it all was very good. The ambiance was very intimate and relaxed. I'd come here again.
