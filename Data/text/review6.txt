Amazing authentic flavorful northern Thai  street food coming out of a food truck. We were hungry and impatient and didn't want to wait in the line for La Barbeque so ditched the line and went to Dee Dee.  

The food is prepared fresh when you order it by the husband and wife team who are the owners.  We tried the Larb Moo, Pad Kapow, and Om Gai. All three were delicious and VERY SPICEY!  The Larb Moo and Om Gai were served with delicious sticky rice patties that you could break off and dip in the food.  There was no warnings that the default spice level is lip burning HOT!  I usually get medium spice at restaurants, and this was even hot for me.  They didn't even ask us what spice level we would prefer.  Knowing this next time I will be sure to request the spice to be turned down a level or two.

The Thai iced tea unfortunately used creamer and not coconut milk. Although my husband still enjoyed the flavor.  

I have been looking for delicious mango sticky rice and I have finally found it!  The mango sticky rice is the real deal here.  It is the best that I have had since being in Thailand.  Melted in your mouth, ripe, and not too sweet.  Perfection.
