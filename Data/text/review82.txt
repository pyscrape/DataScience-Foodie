Yay. Yay! YUM!!

What a great spot for delicious poke bowls!

Believe the overwhelming reviews -- fresh, delicious ingredients, pleasant service, served up in a cute, New York-sized (small) space.

FYI -- if you get salad as your poke bowl base, it comes lightly dressed in a soy type dressing, so you're not eating plain/dry greens with your tuna!

The katsu curries also looked deeeeeelicious. That will be my next try!

I also love how much Elite love Simple has gotten! What a great find!
