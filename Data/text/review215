Phenomenal experience!  This place made me feel like I've given a lot of other places too many stars!  If I'm giving other restaurants 5 starts - I feel like this one should definitely get more!

Comfortable, cozy, unique, delicious.  Definitely an experience and not just a "dinner."  Of course the food is great but cocktails and wine are too!
