The kichin fried chicken bowl is extremely flavorful and delicious. The fried crust is super crispy but the meat itself is still flavorful because it has been marinated separately so that it is infused with flavor. The gimbap was alright -- a little less flavored than I would have liked but still enjoyable. But by far and away the best part of our meal was the rice balls. Holy hell the spicy salmon rice balls are phenomenal! Spicy and fishy and absolutely out of this world with the kimchi aioli. Definitely get these!

The prices are pretty standard but I think the rice balls are definitely the best value -- you get 3 rice balls for $10 and the rice balls are as big as a fist. That's a lot of food. We used the yelp check-in to get a free honeydew iced tea and that was perfect to go with the rest of the meal because it was refreshing and mildly flavored/sweet.

Highly recommend. This spot is close to where we live so we will become regulars for sure.
