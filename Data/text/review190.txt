I love PASTA! And, I love CARBS. Il Corvo Pasta was the first restaurant on my list when I came to visit Seattle and I'd come here everyday for lunch if I could.

Got here a little bit before noon on a Thursday and there was already a line waiting inside the restaurant. I waited for approximately 10 minutes, and luckily found a table right away after I put my ordered down and grabbed my utensils and a glass of water. I got the Papardelle alla Bolognese and it just tasted amazing. Fresh-homemade pasta, killer ingredients, super appetizing. I wish I ordered more dishes or tried them all in one seating! The pasta was cooked to al-dente perfection and were a little chewy, and the sauce was well-balanced: thick, rich, and abundant. And, a true bargain for less than $10!

The place is a little small so please be willing to share a table with other customers if you can! Worth the long lines? Heck yes. Friendly staff? Yes to that too!
