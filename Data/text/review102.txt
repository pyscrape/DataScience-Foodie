Friday = vacation day

After reading previous reviews about Dutch Fred's Kinky Boots drink $14.00 (Tito's vodka, St. Germain, lemon, raspberries), I was enticed for a visit.  Aside from Cyndi Lauper's Broadway show, the actual drink does exist which is prepared fresh complete with one fresh raspberry and one Phalaenopsis Orchid flower.  It is bright pink like Cosmopolitan in color but subtle without the intense sweetness as it is a subtle version.  I highly enjoyed the Kinky Boots drink.  Lunch calls for party of one was at the bar counter.  Dutch Fred's thankfully opens at 12 pm noon on a Friday without the agony of waiting and hunger pangs to loom.  Disposable coasters and business cards are available.  My server Brian was attentive and readily available.  At the bottom of the bill suggested service gratuity of 18%, 20% and 22% is calculated without another other lower percentages.  Dutch Fred's fends the appearance of an old fashioned pub in dark lighting with wooden stools and a straight long wooden bar counter.  Beneath the bar counter contains hooks for bags and jacket placement and working electrical outlets for patrons' tech gadgets to be powered.

Beef burger $15.00 -ground beef chuck with the addition of Monterey Jack cheese was somewhat juicy of brisket blend on challah bun.  I prefer Ciabatta bread for the quality and texture.  I choose French Fries which were served with condiments ketchup and pink mayo ketchup (Mary Rose sauce).

Freddy's Mule $14.00 - Absolut Vodka, Apfel Apple Liqueur, Lime, Ginger Beer with mint and mountains of ice.  Too much green delicious apple flavor and ginger beer that overpowers the drink--surely not my favorite.
