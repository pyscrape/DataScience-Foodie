First time for my wife and I at Barley Swine. We go to Odd Duck a lot. Very good chefs tsating. The service was also great. Didn't do the wine pairing as we wanted to try the Failla pinot on their wine list. Good choice with the tasting menu. Will be back again. They exceeded our foodie expectations.
