I've been in this area for years and on this same exact block and had no idea that Excuse my French was located in a little cozy basement. I had dinner here on a Thursday and it was very packed. Don't worry, grab a beer next door at Top Hops while you wait. The only thing that I didn't like at Excuse my French was the seating. It's basically a long bar all the way down except for a couple small tables in the front. 

As we seated at the bar, the waitress recommended a nice French red that was very good. We ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. We started with a bunch of cheeses and charcuterie. They paired nicely together especially with a little wine sip. We also ordered the duck rillettes which was probably my favorite thing the whole night. We shared a steamed artichoke for the table. Cooked nicely and brought back childhood memories which can sound weird. My other favorite dish was the sea scallop carpaccio. Cut very thin with a lot of flavor. It's topped with salmon caviar and yuzu. 

For my entree, I ordered the duck confit parmentier which is a gorgeous presentation. It's paired with crushed potatoes, olive oil and truffle pure. This dish was pretty good but I thought it would be better. Next time, I'll listen to reviews and order the foie gras lollipops. Heard they are amazing.

For dessert, they gave the table a free crepe. I kid you not, it's because they liked my cousin. It worked out well for me because it was delicious and a great way to finish a meal.
