I was a bit skeptical of this joint when I first walked in. Its a small dainty place in chinatown, not actually known for its fresh fish. However once I tried the poke bowl, all expectations were blown out of the water. 

Many poke bowls require you to pay extra for avocado which makes your bowl $13 + dollars. At simple, it already comes with delicious topping and a guacamole smash that is absolutely delicious. The fish was fresh and flavorful. The only thing that I wasn't too happy about what the amount of toppings, because they give you a little too much. 

This place is super affordable and gives you a big bang for your buck!
