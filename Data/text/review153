Ambiance: 
I love a good downtown restaurant with plenty of seating, good lighting, and an outdoor area. Second Bar + Kitchen checks all three off the list. I was seated inside the last time I went and I can't say I would choose the same spot again. The interior noise level on a Friday night was crazy loud. I could barely hear the soft-spoken waiter try to upsell. Next time, I will sit outside. 

Cuisine:
Whoa. This food is good. I, like the next true Texan, love deep fried pickles from the local grease spoon, but this place can fry a mean pickle. Their take on the most basic dish is revolutionary. Yes, it's a pickle revolution. Pickle slices, drizzled in hot sauce, dipped in ranch it all sounds so basic, but its executed flawlessly. I also had their skirt steak dish, which was cook to a perfect medium rare and served over a bed of crispy potatoes. The whole meal was excellent and if you were strategic about your choices, your bill wouldn't even put a dent in your wallet.  

Service:
For a restaurant that does not take reservations, the hostess was charming and easy going. I would imagine her job isn't the friendliest on Friday nights, but she handled the commotion with grace. Our waiter was also laid back and friendly. They either purposefully hire a certain type of carefree employees or put something in their brownies.
