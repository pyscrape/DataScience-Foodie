Greatness has arrived, seattle!

Really good poke bowls, amazing staff, and delightful dole whip. I need an extra star for this business. The city has been lamenting for extraordinary poke bowls and goPoke has delivered.  Love the location, and it's been nice coming in to such fun smiling people.

My favorite has been the spicy tuna. And then the <adj> phenomenal </adj> dole whip. There will never be a bad day for me again because this place fixes it all. I don't have to dream of traveling to Disneyland or the dole plantation during the middle of the week because this place has it! Thank you and congratulations!!! Wishing you guys an amazing first year.
