Delicious! We split the Ahi tuna salad, buffalo chicken egg rolls, and veggie dumplings. Recommend all 3! The gentleman beside us had the Thai deviled eggs. They looked delicious and he said they were amazing!  Such an awesome little gem! I never would have known such awesome food was hidden inside a bar! It's super nice inside and all the food we saw around us looked delicious as well! Would definitely go back! We were able to make a reservation on Open Table and were sat immediately. I think it would have been fine if we hadn't had a reservation. We went tonight, a Sunday, at 7:00pm. I assume a lot of people pass it by due to the outside, even my fianc said, "We are going to a bar?" Don't judge the book by its cover!
