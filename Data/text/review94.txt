Came here for lunch today and got the king crab poke bowl. The portion size of the food is big however it's mostly rice ( your choice of white or brown or quinoa) The toppings are yummy and of good quality however mixed in felt like it was too much flavors going on. Had hard time differentiating what I was eating. Also the amount of King crab seem real little. The decor of the place is super cute though.
