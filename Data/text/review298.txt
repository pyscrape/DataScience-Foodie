The first time I wanted to stop in was on a Saturday and the line was out the door.  I stopped back on a Wednesday about 3:30 PM and the place was still very busy but I found a table.  Lunch menu is dirt cheap at $10.50.  I had the pickle soup (chicken stock with veggies - OK but different) and a breaded pork cutlet which was very nice. I was a happy camper.

Kind of old fashioned but the place works for me.
