Celebrated my 21st birthday here and it was amazing! My girlfriend and I went on a Tuesday night and surprisingly it was really busy. The noise level was above average and the wait for our food took FOREVER. It was like 30 minute intervals between each course. The portions were ridiculously small (but what else do you expect from a high end restaurant?), however, the food was extraordinary!!! Nothing like I've ever tasted before. As far as drinks, the moscato was delicious! I also ordered Lost Lake (cocktail) and I felt like it was mostly alcohol with a pinch of juice... I only had like 5 sips because it was too strong - would never order again. 

Everything about Canlis is beautiful. From the view even to their bathrooms!! Service was exceptional and I would love to come here again for another special occasion :)
