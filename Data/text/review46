Delicious! Friendly! Fresh!

What a lovely group of employees. They took the time to explain everything for us, first-timers. 

A $15 pok bowl gets you a lot of fish and add-ons, too much for each of us; next time we'll be sharing a bowl. I enjoyed my goPok bowl with spicy ahi, octopus, edamame, crab salad, seaweed salad, all atop brown rice.
