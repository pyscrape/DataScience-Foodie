One way I judge restaurants is by how far I would be willing to drive just to eat their food. Dee Dee is 4.3 miles from where we live. My family all agree that we would be willing to drive a far longer distance and time just to taste their wonderfully herbal and spicy om gai, the delicious and soul-satisfying larb moo, and even their complement of perfectly made sticky rice.

No wonder the Austin Chronicle's Brandon Watson (whose reviews we HIGHLY recommend) wrote: "When you are making food this good ... this worth the effort, you have to believe that a humble trailer is just the beginning."

Dee Dee's? A 10+ mile restaurant in our book - not bad for a food truck!
