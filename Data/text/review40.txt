this is now my <adj> favorite </adj> poke joint in seattle. their fish is fresh from hawaii and it melts in your mouth, it's crazy. they have so many assortments of sauces for their fish and it's laid out chipotle style so you have a lot of room for customization. PLUS the interior is <adj> super cute </adj>. 
i've also tried their dole whip float (i think that's what it's called) and their mochi ice creams and both are really good! i personally love li hing powder (which is what they put on their floats, its kind of like a plum powder??) but i do think i'd prefer just the dole whip on its own.
can't wait to go back here!
