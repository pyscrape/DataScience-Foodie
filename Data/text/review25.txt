My experience here was awesome from start to finish! I don't usually go to fine dining restaurants like this, so my opinion may be different from others who normally go to places like this.  But we drove up, the valet people opened all the car doors and we walked inside. We were greted immediately by the host who also took our jackets and found us a place to sit.  We did not have a reservation so we sat near the bar and the service was excellent.  Luckily they were able to seat us at some tables next to the bar.  Our waitress was extremely curteous and polite the entire night. They made sure our water glasses were full at all times and when they saw our empty drink glasses, they asked if we wanted another. 

The food was delicious. I had the three course meal and started off with the salad. My entree was the pork dish and for dessert I had the creme brulee. I also had a side of truffle fries. Eveeything was excelllent and flavorful.  Everyone had their plates served at the same time. Before we were served dinner, we got cider and a little pastry, which were both delicious! At the end of our meal we also got mini macarons, which were also so good. I mean everything was just so good. 

I was sad to have the meal end.  They did not rush us out the door after they brought us the check.  We made our way out and the host who took our jackets when we walked in was able to remember which ones belonged to us and helped us put them on.  That was impressive. Right when we walked out the door, the valet pulled up with our car and it was even already warm.  I was also impressed by that.  We didn't have to stand and wait. We just walked out of the restaurant and got right into our warm car (it was probably 25 or so that night) and left. 

Definitely an amazing experience from start to finish. Everything was great. The food, the servers, everything. Loved it!
