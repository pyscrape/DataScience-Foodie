Love the feel of this place, hipster, trendy, and little swanky with good food! It was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon and I can see why!

Ordered:
Avocado Fundido - Yum, basically warm guacamole with ground chorizo in the bottom 4/5
SBK Cubano - Pretty good, hubs didn't have any complaints but those horseradish pickles on the side are to die for! 4/5
Romaine Chopped Salad - Pretty good, wish the vinaigrette was a little tangier (I like a lot of vinegar) but I finished it off! 4/5

Drank:
Hotel Nacional - Loved it! Sweet but not too much and refreshing 5/5
Green River - So refreshing, unique and unexpected. I loved it! 5/5

Overall unique menu, lots of delicious to choose from, great atmosphere, a little on the pricier side. Would go back!
