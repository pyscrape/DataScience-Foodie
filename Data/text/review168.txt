We came here with a party of 8 adults. Barley Swine has a great selection of a la carte dishes or the Chef's tasting menu ($90). Not everyone in our party was interested in the Chef's tasting menu. For timing purposes-- either everyone in the party orders the tasting menu or everyone orders a la carte. 

Our group is very close with one another so we opted to do a la carte with a twist! We ordered one of everything on the menu and shared it among the entire party. Once we had tried everything we were all able to order the dishes we wanted, individually. That way we were all able to try the full menu but no one was obligated to order the tasting menu. It was a happy compromise for the entire party. 

I'm glad we did it that way because I really wanted to do the tasting menu, so I was able to try a little bit of everything and then was able to order the dishes I loved the most. Our waiter probably hated us, but we had a great experience. The food was phenomenal! I highly recommend.
