Dutch Freds is a great place for cocktails and bites in a rowdy theatre district bar. It is NOT a good place for quick service or a "sit-down" dinner. Most of the tables, save for a few up front, are high-tops and good for standing around. This used to be the Irish dive bar Blarney Stone...but there's nothing left that is even remotely reminiscent of that place. And it is LOUD! 

From the makers of Tanner Smith's (home of the best eggplant chips in the world), this great cocktail bar is a nice addition to the neighborhood, but it VERY quickly became a bro hangout in the neighborhood. It's not a sports bar...but it sure does feel like one!

The food is good. it's basically the same menu as Tanner's and that is A-OK by me. I do wish that each place had their own special features...because it's just starting to feel like a homegrown Applebee's with food that won't make you sick. 

Come ready to spend a bit more than you're prepared to (because the cocktails really are spectacular...and expensive) and if you're hungry, you'll be fine. I just wouldn't recommend planning on making a meal of it here. And be ready to yell to be heard by your companions, bar tender or wait staff member.
