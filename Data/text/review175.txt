Bswine Bling by Al-eezy

You used to call me on my. You used to, you used to.
You used to call me on my cell phone,
Late night when you need my love.

Ever since I left the city, you got a reputation for yourself now.
Everybody knows and I feel left out.
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out.
'Cause ever since I left the city, you started poachin' fish and servin' duck.
Your glasses of champagne got me awestruck.

You and me, we're meant to get along
I could eat this all day long
Your food makes me feel so strong
Ever since I left the city, you...you got exactly what you asked for
Makin' noodles out of pig skin
Add some hot sauce and it's a total win

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you grillin' up that bacon for someone else,
Wonder if you're rollin' up shiitake pasta for someone else,
Doing things I taught you, servin' 11 courses for someone else,
You don't need no one else, you don't need nobody else, no

And I know when that hotline bling ,
That can only mean one thing,
I know when I Barley Swine,
It's gonna be divine.
