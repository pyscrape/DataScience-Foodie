I missed a friend's HH get together a few months ago, so when a few of my grad school friends decided to have a get together for the new year, I suggested this place as I really want to try it.

I loved the atmosphere as soon as I walked in. It had a cozy decor but also elegant at the same time. We got a table towards the back and I loved the comfortable cushiony high top chairs. The walls also have a lot of plates decoration. 

The drink menu makes you want to literally try everything! I settled for Freddy's Mule which had vodka, apple liqueur, lime, and ginger beer. Yum. It was so good that after the first round, everyone in my party decided to get my drink. The food is definitely better than your average bar food which is a blessing! The only thing that wasn't as great was the vegetable dumplings. Otherwise, the brisket slider was to die for! The waitress had recommended that and she is so right! We also got the buffalo spring rolls. It wasn't bad but there was this weird taste. Maybe it had some sort of cheese in the spring rolls. Not sure. We also got two kinds of flatbread. They were both yummy! I loved the arugula flatbread. So good. Honestly, I wish we tried more things on the menu. They were that good. 

Throughout the night, everyone was so happy with the drinks and food and that I recommended an awesome spot. Now I am responsible for picking out the next spot for another get together. Dutch Fred's will be hard to top.
