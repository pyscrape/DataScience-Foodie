We visited here during a popular Friday lunch service and had high expectations for the restaurant's home-made pasta. We left disappointed but were still glad we had given the place a shot.

The pasta menu here changes from day to day. We ordered:

- Papparadelle with Ragu alla Bolognese
- Baked Lasagna with Sun Gold Tomatoes, Summer Squash, and Toasted Almond
- Giardiniera (seasonal pickles)

Overall, we thought the pasta here was way too thick - some people prefer thick pasta, but we were looking forward to thinner, more elastic pasta. The lasagna in particular was so thick that it was actually a bit hard to cut through, and the papparadelle was so thick and dry that it didn't really hang on to any of the sauce. The seasonal pickles were alright, but we would probably recommend skipping them considering how heavy the pasta dishes were.
