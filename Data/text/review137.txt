I think this was my favorite of the dozen or more restaurants we dined at this weekend. The List is a 21 and over restaurant so no minors of any kind allowed, which is too bad because the kid would love it here.

Sunday and Monday are all day happy hour (half off about half their menu) and $15 bottles of wine!!

We arrived exactly at opening time 5:00 pm sharp on Sunday and were the first to be seated. Good thing too because the place filled up quickly.

We ordered the gnocchi with truffle sauce, hands down the best item on the menu, we got 3 of these! The best gnocchi I have ever had, the perfect texture and bite along with a subtle and delicious sauce. Order one or three of these for yourself!

Meatballs, comes 2 to an order, amazing spicy tomato sauce. Balls were good

Grilled octopus salad, the way that Octopus was meant to be made, perfectly grilled with the right amount of bite left. Simply seasoned with salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Yummy!

Eggplant parm with fresh mozzarella, I'd say one of the weaker fishes, beautiful presentation.

Clams came in a clear briny broth and some  slightly dense bread, which works for this fish. Very good

Bacon wrapped prawns were slightly over cooked, would have been better if they weren't as charred 

Chilean Seabass was a little over seasoned and I didn't like the grain that they served, just ok

Service was impeccable!

Ladies room had a heated toilet seat, kinda psychedelic said a friend.

I'm so glad we got a chance to fine here, a great experience!
