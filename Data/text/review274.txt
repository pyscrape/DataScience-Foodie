A truly welcome addition to this stretch of Broadway. It's small with plenty of light so you can either grab-and-go or sit in the window and the counter and watch the world go by. There are a few tables as well. 

I checked in the with the yelp and got the deeeelicious iced tea for free with my lunch. I went with the classic beef bibambop which was simple and flavorful. The whole experience was cheap, cheerful, and quick. 

I couldn't ask for more. What's more, they deliver. All in a all good quick food before or after the train.
