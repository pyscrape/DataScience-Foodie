This was my first time at Second Bar + Kitchen and I really enjoyed it. I liked the inside decor of the restaurant which was pretty modern. I sat outside this time, but it was still pretty nice. I went on a Friday afternoon, so it was quite busy with a lot of people who work in downtown. Service was still quick and good though. 

I got the charcuterie board and black and bleu pizza and shared it with a friend. The charcuterie board was pretty good, I especially liked the chicken liver mousse. But I feel like I was mostly paying for the presentation of it. The black and bleu pizza was great. It had a good combination of sweet and salty. It was a bit too oily, but that's a given since it had pork belly on it. 

As we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter for a to go box. He said he'd pack it up and bring it out, but he never brought it out and we waited for awhile to ask him about it. However, we didn't see him and none of the workers seemed to be coming outside since we were the only ones left outside. We didn't want to keep waiting since it was cold outside and just left..we assume he must've just forgotten. But overall, I liked it and would come back again.
