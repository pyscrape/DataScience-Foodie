The food here was around a 3.5 star, but the ambiance lowered my rating down to a solid 3. When you walk in, the restaurant is almost completely dark. The lack of lighting makes the meal a bit gloomy. 

I had the soba noodles with avocado which was actually pretty damn good. The portion was massive and the mushrooms in it were super good. 

Also ordered at the table was the, avocado chicken salad sandwhich and the kale salad with shrimp.
The sandwhich was good, nothing to write home about. The kale salad was almost inedible. It was probably the worst looking salad I've ever seen, plus the lack of shrimp. 

Won't be back, but not an awful move if you're close by.
