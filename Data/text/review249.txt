This is now on my top favorite Broadway bar and eating establishment list.  This place is classy, eclectic, and whimsical.  Passion went into building this space, and goes into making the food and drinks every night.  The menu focuses on locally sourced and seasonal ingredients (whenever possible).  The food has a slight Spanish Medditeranean focus.  Many of the dishes are made to be small and shareable.  Their cocktials change seasonally, and they even barrel age some of their cocktails and spirits in house.  They have a comprensive bar program centered around Italian Amari drinks.  Their cocktail menu is divided between Bitter and Herb focused drinks.  You can find the drink menu on the table in the children book covers.  

The space is beautiful and the interior design is amazing.  Inside is cozy, dark, and classic.  Walk to the back and you enter an indoor/outdoor patio area with a retractable roof and lights.

Staff were friendly and accommodated food sensitivities well.  The food was cooked to perfection.  Very tasty and fresh.  I loved my Catalonian fish stew and my friends loved the Spanish adobo beef skewers and baby kale ceasar salad.  The spanish cheese plate though with the special nuts were AMAZING!!! Everything looked as good as it tasted.  The desserts they said were also delicious - the olive oil yogurt sponge cake and chocolate coconut pot de crme.

The highlight was the craft cocktails. While the food was great, the cocktails were INCREDIBLE!  Very unique flavors blended together. Combinations of flavors I have never seen together on a drink menu.  Creative and talented bartenders! 

We had a very enjoyable time here.
