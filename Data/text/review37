I made my way out to Seattle for a birthday trip and was lucky enough to be able to make a reservation a reservation two weeks prior to the trip. It definitely increased my chances when I put was in town for a weekday. Ask for a window seat! The view is amazing, even in the evening. But if you're lucky enough to get reservations during sunset, the view of Lake Union is beyond words!

The entry to Canlis is a little tricky especially at night. It's the last right turn into what seems like an alley way. If you miss the turn, you end up going across the waters to turn around. You can only enter from one side, upon entering the driveway slopes down, so you're unsure where you are going until you see the valet. Valet is complementary but tips is greatly appreciated.

The food was amazing! The salmon was soft and buttery! The drinks we're not too light but strong enough. The presentation of each dish is mesmerizing. I don't think there was anything we did not like. It's worth the price if your into fine dining.
