I just want to start by saying, "Yes, this place is over-hyped right now." HOWEVER, this doesn't take away from my opinion of the food, service, and overall experience. Everything we had was delicious and for all the reviewers that complained that the portions are small - yes, they are...because it's a tapas place. Between 2 of us we had 4 dishes and were stuffed by the end. 

I'm pretty sure the reason this place is so hyped is because adults are pretty much just giant children that like to drink out of fun receptacles. I would honestly go back for those fun "adult capri suns". They're delicious too! We got the Lemon Annie (like a sweet lemonade) and the Ms. Cuteini (V refreshing with cucumber and lime)

FOOD: 

- Truffle Mac & Cheese: AMAZING. Cheesy, warm, and chewy (there are clams in this dish) with just the right amount of truffle 
- Kale Salad: It was a run of the mill salad to me. Apparently there are Brussels sprouts in this, but I don't think I got any
- Korean Pancake: Very good if you like seafood. We ended with this one, but probably should have started with it because it's pretty heavy. Has the consistency of an eggy pancake which might put people off.
- Chicken: SO. GOOD. MUST. TRY. Kinda like the sweeter cousin of general tsos

Please listen to the reviews that say this place fills up fast - it does and we got there by 6:15 for two of us. By 7:00 the place had racked up at least an hour wait - so get there early or be prepared to wait.
