I took one of my best friends out to dinner here for her birthday last weekend. It was PERFECT! This place is such a cute little "French tapas bar." It is a chic, cozy, tight, artsy environment with good drinks & interesting small plates of French food. It is on the pricier side but definitely well worth it. Great friendly service. No reservations, walk ins only. We lucked out and got a table for 2 in the back, whereas the majority of the restaurant is seated at the bar. I would definitely recommend for an intimate outing, catching up with a friend, out for a special occasion, or just out with a couple girlfriends :)
