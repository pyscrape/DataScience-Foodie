Finally!!! It's been 4 long years I've lived in Austin with not good to just ok Thai food. Thai food is easily one of my favorite cuisines, but it's one I have not enjoyed while living here #1stworldproblems. Thanks to Justin and Lakana (the super sweet couple behind this food truck) there is now legit real Thai food here in Austin!

Tried the Moo Ping (pork skewers), Pad Ka Pow (mint pork as my peeps in LA would call it), Som Tum (papaya salad), Mango with Sticky Rice, and their home brewed Thai Iced Tea. All were on point bursting with a full depth of flavor and wonderful textures. This, my dear friends, is what Thai food should taste like. Their sticky rice is exactly how it ought to be too where you can eat it with your hands like bread.

Many complain about the continued influx of people moving to Austin. No doubt there are downsides, but few note the good that comes with it. An increase in diversity and a demand for better food are two positives and Dee Dee is a clear example of this.

Justin and Lakana, thank you for bringing awesome Thai food to Austin. You have a new regular now along with everyone else I plan on singing your praises to!

P.S. Special thanks to Jack C. who I first heard of Dee Dee from.
