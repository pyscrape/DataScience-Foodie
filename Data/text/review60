Reasons I love Thursday Kitchen:

1. Great food -- We got the soft shelled crab, angry sweet potatoes, kimchi paella, edamame dumplings, and popcorn ice cream for dessert. Every single dish was wonderful. The paella was a better texture and more flavorful than most Spanish and Latin American places I've been to in NYC. 4 dishes (5 if you include dessert) is plenty for two people to split and each dish is roughly $9-$12. 
2. $3 beer any time of night. Always a plus. 
3. $1 coffee. Yes please. 
4. Good service. Our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Made great recommendations. 
5. Nice atmosphere. It's not such a big place and it's popular, so get there close to opening if you don't want to wait. But it's cozy and well decorated. 
6. This is a big one...glowing soju Capri sun style drinks. This is a game changer. They serve you alcohol in a glowing pouch. Whoever though of this is a genius!!! The in we child in me leapt for joy upon discovering this menu item. 

Over very positive experience.
