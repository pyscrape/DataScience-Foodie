The decor and ambiance is great. Cozy.

Waiter was positive and helpful on wine and food selections.
But too busy overall and he rarely was to be seen. Waited quite a while to place orders.

The disappointment was on food. The 'assagio' which is an assortment of ravioli and gnocchi was really not compelling at all. The gnocchi were quite overdone, and just mushy balls of something. Nothing tasted good at all! That was definitely 2 stars.

Burrata appetizer way too small.

My dish, which was wild boar and fettucine was better. I'd rate that 3 stars, as in A OK.

Friends chicken dish was quite good, I'd give that 3 stars, maybe 3.5.

Wine selection was 3 stars. Decent price ($40) and decent quality.

So overall 3 stars. But those ravioli really sucked. 

I would not return here.
