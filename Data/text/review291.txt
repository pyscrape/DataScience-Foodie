I definitely agree with the other reviewers. This place is a true gem. I've had Polish food elsewhere in the city, but it doesn't stack anywhere close to Karczma. For its portions and quality, it's worth every buck. It's not even that expensive too, well within reasonable margins.

The plate of Polish specialities is a good place to start for the uninitiated. For $13, you can get a big plate for various assortiments including bigos (Hunter's stew), pierogy (the dumplings), potato pancakes, and a kielbasa sausage. There's also a variety of kebabs for the mains, but my friends regard the pork shoulder as really good. Per person, each main dish should not crack over $15. If you're with a bunch of carnivores, the grilled plates for 2 or 3 would be artery-clogging heaven. 

I usually order a plate of pierogies even when the plate of Polish specialities has a few of them. But they're so good I had to get more. I also ordered the lard once. It tastes a little exquisite. If you're not too adventurous with food, skip the lard and bread. 

Servers are really nice. They also wear costume, which fits with the decor of the restaurant, supposedly an adaption of a traditional Polish home. Great drink selection, a bunch of great beers and there's also some port to close out the night.
