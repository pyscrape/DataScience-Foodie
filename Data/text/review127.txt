How to get on the List: 

Don't forget your ID! This place cards you even if you don't order alcohol because it's "technically" a bar.

Be prepared for a 30 - 45 min wait during happy hour. 

If there's bar table seats, take it!! 

The food isn't too shabby for happy hour prices, but nothing really stood out to me except the truffle gnocchi. Cause hello! Truffle!! 

What we shared: 

Ahi tuna - It comes with 2 slices of tuna topped with lentils and kale. It needs a little more flavor, this dish was kind of bland compared to the rest we tried.

Truffle gnocchi - butter licking goooood - the cream was the best part fa'sho. 

Spicy meatballs - a little too spicy for my taste buds, I suspect they had red pepper flakes? Or whatever those little yellow pepper seeds are.. 

Top sirloin - wasn't part of the happy hour menu. The steak was a bit too burnt, on the edges, decent slices though. The cheese in the salad was delectable. 

Overall not too shabby for happy hour, I wouldn't come here any otherwise.
