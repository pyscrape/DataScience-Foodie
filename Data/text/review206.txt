This is one of the places I wanted to love but was underwhelmed. The place is super cute, and it was mentioned as one of the best new restaurants in Austin by Bon Appetite Magazine. 

My bf and I were walk-ins, they didn't appear busy but were catering to resos made prior, so our only option was to sit at the high-top tables by the bar, no big deal. However, I was super bummed when the hostess told us we wouldn't be able to have the dim sum cart roll by our table bc it may get in the way near the front entrance, and the height difference between the cart and high tops would be "awkward". IMO, sitting at the high-tops would give you the perfect bird eye view of the dim sum cart! Also I felt having the dim sum cart at Emmer & Rye is half the experience! I felt we weren't part of the true emmer & rye dining experience. I feel like management should make the dim sum cart work in all areas of the restaurant, probably would've ordered more dim sum if we could see it. (Note: although we couldn't dim sum cart service, we were still able to order from the dim sum menu) 

From my understanding the menu rotates, but nothing stood out to me. The food was ok, nothing blew me away. I think we ordered 6 plates total. The spaghetti pasta was a little undercooked and you maybe got 3-4 bites out of it for $16. The desert was ok too. My cocktail was small, maybe 4oz. My bf spent a lot of money here for the two of us and we were still hungry. Treated him to Banger's shortly after. 

For being named one of the best new restaurants from a prestigious magazine, I was a little disappointed. I do want to come back, but I'll be sure to come when the menu stands out to me. I also hear brunch servings are larger than dinner so, gotta try that too.
