I love this little place. From the booking of the reservation with Sharlene ( who is wonderful) to the attention to details from the waitress lisa. to the food itself? Top Notch. So much so, that while we were there to celebrate my son's 24 Birthday.. my best friend booked the date for her 50th Birthday. They take good care of you here.
