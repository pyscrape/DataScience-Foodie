Came into the city last night and I had to go to
Dutch Freds...  This place is great! It's decor is on the contemporary side with classic details, I especially loved the black and white movies playing in the background. I ordered the Working Class Hero, their smokey whiskey drink, it was beautifully presented and the drink was great! We also ordered a few small plates, all were delicious but the buffalo chicken spring rolls were my favorite.  Our server Tracey was very nice and attentive. Can't wait to come back!
