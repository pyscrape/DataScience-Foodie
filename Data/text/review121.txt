This was absolutely my favorite place to eat at in Seattle!

I've gone here 3 out of the 6 days that I was in Seattle because I was very impressed with the happy hour menu. I came as a party of 2 each time I ate here and never had to wait more than 40 mins for a spot (even though the restaurant was always full and we were given estimates of 1-1.5 hrs).

I've only ordered from the happy hour menu and enjoyed every single item I ordered. Food on the happy hour menu range between $6-9 and the portions are generous. I've ordered the handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream; flatbread with feta cheese, cranberries, and pine nuts; sea salt and pepper calamari; spicy meatballs; grilled octopus salad; bacon-wrapped prawns; grilled chilean sea bass; and seared ahi tuna fillets.

Everything was seriously delicious, but, out of the items I ordered, I highly recommend the gnocchi (it was heavenly!), spicy meatballs, salt and pepper calamari, and grilled chilean sea bass! 

This is a spot that I will look forward to eating at when I visit Seattle again!
