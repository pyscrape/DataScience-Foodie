I came here on a Thursday evening, and was seated in the back. It had a very relaxed atmosphere with string lights and high ceilings - super cute! My friend and I started off with a couple drinks, I had the none ya beeswax? It was a citrus-y cocktail topped with beeswax foam. It was the first time I've ever heard of that, but there wasn't much to the taste of the foam, I think it's just there for intrigue and aesthetic purposes. 

Food wise, we shared the meatballs, shrimp, and gnocchi. I think my favorite was the gnocchi - perfectly fluffy, and paired very well with the earthiness of the squash and chanterelle mushrooms. 

The meatballs and shrimp were very flavorful, I just wish the accompanying bread provided was better. While very tasty, these two dishes didn't blow my mind. 

The service was efficient and not overpowering. I really enjoyed my time here and will definitely return.
