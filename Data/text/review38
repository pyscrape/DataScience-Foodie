My fist time at canlis and I was so excited to try out this fancy restaurant. My boyfriend and I were celebrating our year and a half anniversary.

Service was excellent and food was perfectly timed. Waiting at the bar I had the red griffin, whew too sweet! 

Now in the dining area, I ordered the 4 course which included 2 apps, main course, and dessert.

My oysters were delicious, however, peppercorns were too chunky in the mignonette and coarsely destroyed my palette. 

Next was foie gras. I was so excited for this! However it was crafted as a moose, and was incredibly rich and not pleasant. Served with sliced apples, layered with a thick apple chunk and all on a brioche cracker thing. I did not enjoy this at all. Less is more, I'd rather it had been more balanced with some earthy greens to cut the heaviness of the moose. Too sweet and too heavy. 

Next was my main course, duck with squash! My duck was so so so tough. Very disappointing. I chewed my way through because, well, I was hungry. 

Dessert was banana moose. This was pretty good. Didn't look pretty but, tasty. 

Overall service was great! Food, not so great. 

Poorly balanced dishes (in my opinion of course!) I think everything was too heavy, too sweet and my duck died without being prepared well. Poor duck. I needed a salt lick instead of an after dinner macaroon.
