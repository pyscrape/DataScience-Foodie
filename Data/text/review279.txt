The service here was amazing! Their dumplings were also good. This is not a great place to bring a group as the space is small but a great place to have a casual lunch with a friend or by yourself. It has a nice laid back and family feel. My entree meal was the Fried Chicken, which could've been better. Tasted like it was burned on some sides. However, I will be back to try their other options.

Also, their Lemon Honey Iced Tea is the BOMB.
