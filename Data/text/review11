Dee Dee food trailer has a really good thing going on! We visited Dee Dee trailer a mere 4 days after they opened and they didn't miss a beat. Thanks Jack C. for organizing this awesome UYE and for putting this place on the map for us.

Dee Dee is not only serving up some of the best trailer food I have tasted, Lakana and Justin are making some of the best Thai food I have tasted. The duo are both incredibly talented and kind. 

First things first, this food trailer park is both pup friendly and BYOB. During our visit we tried the following:

Moo Ping - Choice of 2 or 5 perfectly marinated pork skewers with a side of delicious sticky rice and spicy tangy fish sauce. I loved everything I tried but the moo ping was my absolute favorite!

Larb Moo - The larb moo is bursting with amazing flavors! This dish has spicy minced pork with Thai basil, lime, cucumber slices, cilantro and rice. Bonus eating this dish with your hands is encouraged.

Pad Kapow - I hardy portion of stir fried pork, Thai basil with a delightful jasmine rice, cold cucumber and topped with a fried egg. 

Sticky Mango - We ended things on a pleasantly sweet note! This traditional Thai dessert has slices of luscious mango on top of rice with sweet coconut milk dressing. 

If you are thirsty I also recommend their wonderful tasting and gorgeous Thai tea.

What a fabulous new trailer in east Austin!
