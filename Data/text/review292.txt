Karczma is located in the heart of Greenpoint, Brooklyn (aka the home of the traditional polish people) so you've come to the right place for authentic Polska food. Inside you'll find an array of people, but best believe Polish people come here because the food is legit. Received a menu with nothing but Polish inside? Nie rozumiem po polsku? Do not fear, they have an English menu. The waitresses wear traditional folk dresses and the decor is rustic with a farmhouse feel. 

Before ordering anything, you MUST order the zurek. (On the menu as barszcz biay / white borscht). This soup is probably one of my favorite things in the world. It comes with potatoes with bacon; put the potatoes and bacon in the soup. It's a must! Order the cheese and/or meat perogis and make sure they're pan fried, as well as traditional kielbasa. Once you get these major staples down, I would recommend trying other things such as the hunters bacon, the stuffed cabbage, or the spicy beef goulash over potato pancake. 

The prices are beyond reasonable, the food is delicious, and the portions are large. Be prepared to wait at least 15 mins+ if you're coming in during dinner time. Order a beer at the bar, Zywiec recommended, to pass time - na zdrowie!
