I was instantly intrigued when I noticed that a Korean restaurant was not located in K-town. Korean fusion/tapas is something you don't normally see and I knew I was in for a treat. Thursday Kitchen is cozy and intimate and boasts a rustic chic vibe. Awesome service from start to finish.

We were a group of six and came in on a Saturday night around 6:45. Since the restaurant does not seat you until your whole party arrives, we were very glad to find that we could order drinks at the bar while waiting (there is always one person who is late...). I got a Ms. Cutetini, which was refreshing and light, and my friend got a Lychee Reach Rich, which was sweet and fun. Both drinks were stronger than anticipated and of course, it is always fun to drink a light-up drink in a pouch. 

The food was equally as fun. The kitchen does a great job of cooking traditional Korean dishes and adding creative twists to each. Some of the flavors were very unique and 'fusion' was accomplished. Standouts of the night included the Kimchi Paella (more of a risotto texture but it was so flavorful and the caramelized kimchi made the dish) and the Crispy Chicken (a glorified General Tso's Chicken, tender and juicy, instant kick of flavor). 

There was a constant stream of people coming in and average wait time (overheard from our table) was at least 40 minutes. Come earlier or later than the dinner rush hour and not only will your wait time be less, but you can get a free beer with your Yelp check-in (6-6:30 and 10-close).

Overall, Thursday Kitchen is FUN and definitely something worth trying at least once. But, I would recommend Thursday Kitchen for smaller parties because 1) it will be easier to get seated and 2) it will be easier to leave with full stomachs - our party of six spent a bit ($$) but none of us left full. We had to grab a second dinner.
