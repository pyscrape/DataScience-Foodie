Came late and they have a fairly small kitchen so so couple things were 86'd off the menu
Counter person was very apologetic and very friendly and helfpull
He suggested the kimchi dumpling so I went for it
Delicious , piping hot and ready in a few minutes ...again on my way out the guy apologized about not having the full menu available
All around good experience will def update my review once i sample the bulgogi and rice balls
