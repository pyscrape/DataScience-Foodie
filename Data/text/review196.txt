Getting to try Il Corvo can be an ordeal but if you make it in you are rewarded with amazing food!  They are only open on weekdays at lunch time; it's a small place and you order at the counter first before you can sit.  This leads to a long line which can be frustrating.  They only make three pastas a day, which means it's easy to try everything if you have enough people or are hungry enough.  My husband and I shared their proscuitto with pickled celery appetizer and it was delicious!  The meat was perfect.  Then we shared one of each of the 3 pastas of the day and they were all so good in different ways!  You can tell it's handmade and it reminded me of the pasta at Bestia in LA.  I was in heaven and the food made the stress of getting to try it worth it.  I would come here whenever I have the chance!  Il Corvo is a must in Seattle!
