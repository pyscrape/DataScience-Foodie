Stopped by just for desserts and turned out to be better than expected. Had the peanut butter pie which seemed like a light mousse like texture on top of thin chocolate cake crust with perfect sweetness. It was served with chocolate icecream and crumble which completed the bite of the pie. All in all a pretty yumm dessert!
