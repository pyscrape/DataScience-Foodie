Came here to try their adult capri suns. I didn't get to try their food because we were short on time and there was already a long wait. We went by the bar and ordered a round of lyce reach rich which was soju, lyce, and mango. Our drinks were served in plastic bags with LED ice cubes. The drinks were delicious and strong. We also tried the pure Jeremy which was soju, muddled strawberries, and yuzu. Both tasted good and couldn't tell there was 20% alcohol inside. I saw them washing and hanging the plastic bags so I believe they reuse them..Can't comment on the food, but the drinks are yummy. Also the bar is cash only!
