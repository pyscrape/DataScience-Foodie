Surprisingly good! It's amazing how this shop has not gotten the buzz and food sites write ups. It should be on everyone's list! The price points on each dish is great. Affordable for the fresh seafood and/or curry dishes. Service was wonderful and you could see it's family owned vibe.

I went with the ahi tuna bowl with brown rice. All ingredients were fresh and the tuna was seared perfectly with a large portion of tuna. The accompanying ingredients all matched well for the bowl such as the garlic chips, asago, seaweed salad, and pickled vegetables. Filling and satisfying for a meal. Small spot with a long table and a table for two with most folks either taking our or eating quickly.

I'll definitely be back and will go for the curry katsu next.
