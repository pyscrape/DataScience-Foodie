I like that Emmer & Rye constantly changes up their menus based on season, but that means that writing about specific dishes isn't all that helpful as you are unlikely to see the same things on the menu when you visit.  That said there are two items everyone at our table agreed were wonderful: the kale and lentils salad, and the lentils and goat cheese toast (it tasted as good as it looks).  We tried a couple of their freshly spun pastas which were very tasty but not easily shared.  The roasted carrots good but not memorable. For dessert we had the ice cream sandwich; it just didn't do it for me.  After we were served the pastas, appetizers and sides, then the dim sum carts came rolling our way.  Unfortunately, we were too full by then to try those temptations.

Pro Tip: Wait for the dim sum carts before going "all in".....
