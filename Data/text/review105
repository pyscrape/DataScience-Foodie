A YELP map search find!
I took the Husband to see the tree and as we were walking around we wanted a nice place to have a drink.   Not a beer, but a well made cocktail.  So I did a YELP Map search for Cocktail and found Dutch Freds was close by. OK, truth is we were lured in by the two $$.  I Should have known that $$ means $$$ as our drinks were $14 each.  We didn't mind paying though due to the quality of the food and drink.  My husband ordered The "Working Man" $14 and is amazing! It Comes in a bottle filled with the mixed drink and sealed with smoke, wait a moment then pour over an ice ball.  It was so good we both had a second one.
The Deviled Eggs $14 for 3! Delicious but a bit too pricey.  
This was a cool spot and loved the drinks and service was above and beyond good.
