Gonna start the year off with reviewing a great recommendation from a co-worker!

Getting here early is key but even though we did during the week between Christmas and New Years we had the standard long wait...in the cold at that.

Totally worth the wait though.  I had the pappardelle bolognese and the castelvetrano olives along with the wonderfully baked rosemary bread.  The pasta was cooked an absolutely perfect al dente.  Not only was it worth waiting in the cold for this meal but it was worth galavanting from downtown to Pioneer Square as well.

The seating can be shared so you get somewhat of a communal dining experience if you're into it.  The meal is a great value for what you get.  Once you get through the line, the wait for the food is minimal and the service is very nice.

Looking forward to another get-away here during the next work lull.
