I had no idea what emmer was until I dined at Emmer and Rye! If you can appreciate milling your own flour, handmade pasta and local/garden produce, then this is your spot. 

Grab a few shareable bites from the menu and Dave room to order off the dim sum carts. You'll probably want to grab 2-3 dishes per person. 

I had the field pea hummus that is super creamy and will convert you to your non traditional hummus pretty quick. 

The grilled squash and zucchini salad with onion petals and roasted garlic was so fresh, colorful and fragrant. 

The strozzapretti it's confit chicken, chili, garlic, mushroom and basil was amazing (could have been lighter on the butter). But, I loved this dish and would get it again! 

Save room for dessert because you'll want to order the seasonal ice cream sandwich. When we went, it was the Rosemary ice cream sandwich with a Koji cookie and fig preserve. WOW! I wish I had my own and didn't have to share! 

The staff are so attentive and the ambience is chill, naturey and modern with a fresh vibe.
