A good friend of ours chose this spot for a catch up dinner and it has the perfect ambiance for that. It felt warm and cozy with a woodsy feel to it. Overall, we had a great time with good food. I remember enjoying the stuffed cabbage and potato pierogies the most. I'd recommend this place and come again if friends were looking for a Polish spot.
