Came here last night.  A bit rainy out so expected to see almost no one.  There was enough to keep everyone busy here.  We sat at the bar. 2 of us.  Jason helped us and made recommendations for happy hour.  I have the Hollow Ridge Cab i think it was.  Pretty nice.  Im not a huge wine guy myself but it was a nice glass of wine.  I did not eat however my friend had the short ribs and couldnt stop raving about how good they were.  Not gonna lie a bit pricey but hey its Lincoln avenue and its a great place when you might want to put on your dang ole fancy pants for the night.  Expect to pay about 6 to 10 for a glass of wine and 20 bucks a plate for food.  If you know that ahead of time you will be good i think.  Like that one guy said once...." I'll be back!"
