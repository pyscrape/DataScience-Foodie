Dutch Freds was a hip and trendy spot for dinner.  It was so crowded on a Thursday night with everyone crowded around the bar.  I would rec you make a reservation because people sit and stay for a while even if it's for an early dinner.  The host was nice enough to give us a table that was reserved in an hour from that time.  The food came out quickly enough and we devoured it all quickly enough to give up that table for that reservation. 

I seriously loved the sliders so much - they were an order of 3 sliders and each looked so juicy and delicious!  I wish there were more for an order!! Yum!!! The 2nd favorite was the chicken wings that had a dry rub with a kick.  3rd fav was the NY Poutine, but seriously was not the best poutine I've had - we were disappointed in that there wasn't enough gravy versus the cheese on it.  It was more like regular cheese fries, is that what made it NY style???  False advertising hah.  The least fav was the duck rolls - there wasn't much of a crunch to them and the duck was a bit bland.  The sauces that they provided didn't really help it, only mask how bland it was to the taste buds.  

Would come back here again for more of those sliders and wings!! Yum!!!  Love the atmosphere of this place!
