Based on the reviews, i had to try Karczma for Polish food in Greenpoint. I'm now rubbing my satisfied belly after a serving of white borscht in a breadbowl, accompanied with mashed potatoes with bacon. I washed it down with a pint of Tyskie Lager and i am a happy Polish-American. Excellent value for NYC- soup+potatoes $5.50, beer $6. I'd absolutely come back to try more. 
Also a great ambience with country style decor and gorgeous waitresses in traditional Polish costume.
