From the decor, service and drinks, this was to get a 5* rating. However, the few appetizers we ordered turned out to be meh, bringing down the rating a bit.

Herb & Bitter is a classy tapas bar on the north end of broadway in Cap Hill, which makes finding parking easier. This place comes highly recommended by many cocktail enthusiasts.

Decor: 5*
Artistically decorated and tastefully lit in the right places, it gives you a good feeling as you walk in the door. The restaurant is not too large, so it's good for small groups. The ambiance is not exactly quiet, but is also a fun date place. They also have a small outdoor area in the back open during summers.

Drinks: 5*
We ordered four different cocktails, and all of them turned out to be excellent. I specially recommend the mood indigo if you like fruity & citrus-y drinks, and the wooden nail if you enjoy scotch & bitters based drinks. Very well made and sophisticated.

Tapas: 3.5*
We didn't order too much, so don't take this as a place not to eat at, but what we ordered wasn't that great. We tried the papas bravas, which turned out to be steamed potatoes with some salsa and garlic aioli. The potatoes were a little raw, and not completely cooked. Even the marcona almonds were bland and not well salted or seasoned.

Service: 4*
Service is very friendly and professional. However, I felt that multiple servers kept checking up on us too often and unnecessarily.

I really enjoyed most of my experience here, especially the cocktails. Will definitely be coming back. This place gets my recommendation.
