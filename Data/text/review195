On a rare day off, I decided to visit Il Corvo for lunch. Can't believe it's been over a year and a half since I last visited! Ten minutes before opening, I'm eighth in line. The line ends up being the entire length of the restaurant, out the door and up the sidewalk towards 3rd and James. Continuously during lunch rush. Folks know though that their patience will be handsomely rewarded.

I'm making the most of it by buying some pasta shells from their studio, four signature shortbread, the prosciutto pickled celery plate, and my favorite dish - the papparadelle with scrumptious meat sauce topped with cheese! I was surprised that the guy behind the counter had faint recognition and wondered where I'd been all this time. Telling him I work now in Lynnwood is all he had to know, as he carefully packaged up the pasta and shortbread.

Dining solo I made quick work of my mega starter and pasta bowl. As I was finishing my last four bites, another couple asked to share my table. It's a fleeting thing, really with the line out the door, one has to relinquish valuable dining space which I was happy to do.

The sun was out, my tummy very satisfied, big smile across my face, and I was in downtown Seattle...thanks again Chef Mike Easton and staff! Your culinary magic remains genuine, consistent, and for now, the closest I can get to Italy using my imagination. Grazie mille!
