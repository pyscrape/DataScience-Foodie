Used this place as a pre-theater dinner and drinks spot with my partner. We were both very satisfied with out food and drinks but couldn't get over how poor the service was.

Decorated like an old-timey NYC bar, this place has plenty of bar counter and tables to accommodate many patrons. My partner and I had a reservation for dinner and were seated very promptly but that was the only thing that was timely. I don't know if the staff weren't that good or if they were overwhelmed but there seemed to only be one server for most of the tables and the lack of interaction with each table really stood out.

The cocktails are great and the prices are reasonable for being in the touristy/theater district. I was a huge fan of the Smoking Reverend ($14) which featured bourbon and and a red wine reduction. The food was hot and interesting and can be classified as gastropub-type fare. I was a fan of the duck confit spring rolls ($14) and the everything pretzels ($12). The spring rolls were filed with duck and came with two great sauces. The best part of the pretzels were the grain mustard and cheese sauces. There were many interesting menu items and the ones I had were executed perfectly.

Overall, this place is a good option for a more casual cocktail pre-theater option. There were plenty of menu items to keep the pickiest eaters happy and there were plenty of delicious cocktails to choose from. If you can get over the lack of service, you won't be disappointed with this restaurant and bar.
