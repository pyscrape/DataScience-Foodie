Man oh man! Seattle has some great food. This by far was fave. I love carbs especially in pasta form. This place here is GOLD. The wait was surprisingly not that long maybe 15-20 mins. You order your own food and pay then find a seat and someone brings your plate out pretty quickly. So fast service. 

The menu was a little confusing but this was because we were expecting an actual menu with different types of pasta. Luckily the super friendly cashier explained there was only 3 options for the day. 

I had what I think was the SALSA VERDE pasta. It was thing pasta with some type of crumbs on top. Holy baby Jesus it was the best dang pasta I have ever tasted. I finished every bit of it and still wanted more.

My bf had the parpadelle a la bolangnes and his was really good too.

We both enjoyed our plates. I can't wait until the next time I'm in Seattle to come back and try more.
