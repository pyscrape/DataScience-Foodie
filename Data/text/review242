After being obsessed with their drink concoctions, I decided to come in to Herb & Bitter for a Xmas Eve dinner with my boyfriend and his brother. I was excited to try their menu, but was sorely disappointed and confused at the hodge podge of menu items. While nothing really sounded that good...we got 3 dishes to share, and that was more than enough. We ordered the: 

Charcuteria: this place had some salami, chorizo, and 20 month old jamon. and macrona almonds. The chorizo and almonds were the only good thing on the dish, and I'm pretty sure I got terribly sick from that jamon. Overall, the dish left much more to be desired. 

Spanish Adobo Beef Skewers: the beef skwers presentation was nice, but I think these should be renamed "Salt Skewers" because they were so salty and so difficult to eat. I could hardly get those down. 

Pork Belly with Apple Sauce & Fig Vinegar: this was one of their specials for the night, and it was easily the best thing on the menu! The pork was cut and cooked well, and the applesauce and fig vinegar really complemented the whole dish.

Catalonian Sauteed Seasonal Greens: one of the only vegetables dishes that wasn't carb loaded and sounded mildly okay. I think it may of been over-sauteed, and had way too much going on in the dish. 

If I decide to risk this place for another try, I'm definitely skipping the entire food menu and only getting drinks! So disappointed in the food, and their menu seems equally confused at what cuisine it's trying to be. Still love the ambiance of the whole place, but the food is a total miss.
