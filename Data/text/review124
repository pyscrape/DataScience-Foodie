Came for their all day happy hour around 4:45pm on a Sunday and luckily didn't have to wait at all! We got seated right away at a table in the back. The ambiance of this restaurant is VERY intimate. It's dimly lit and cozy.. as in you're literally less than a feet away from another table. Definitely a romantic place to be. 

Unfortunately, we were super full from our weekend of intense eating so we didn't get to try as many items on the menu as I would've liked. I'll definitely be back to try more, but we got:

x Sea Salt & Pepper Calamari ($5.50 During HH): This was good!! The calamari, like all other seafood in Seattle, was fresh and chewy. Easily the best calamari I've ever had.

x Grilled Chilean Sea Bass ($8 During HH): This was also tasty! My boyfriend wasn't a huge fan, but I really liked it. The sea bass was laid on top of a bed of risotto. I thought the taste of the sea bass and risotto really complemented each other well.

x Red Wine ($3.99): Got the job done.

Next time, I really want to try the Gnocchi, Pan Roasted Natural Chicken with Mushrooms, Spicy Meatballs, Bacon-Wrapped Gulf Prawns, Baked Broccoli, Clam, Eggplant Parmigiana, or the Seared Ahi Tuna Fillet.
