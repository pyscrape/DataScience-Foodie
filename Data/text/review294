Pleasantly satisfied with our experience here, plus it was our first time at a Polish restaurant! I highly recommend the plate of Polish specialties with potatoe pancakes, pierogies of different flavors (potatoe, mushroom), Hunter's stew, stuffed cabbage, etc. It did not come with sour cream but I suggest you ask for it on the side (great with the potatoe pancakes and pierogies!

For appetizers, we ordered the blood sausage (generous portion size) and the white Borscht soup (was my favorite part of the meal). The soup was supposed to come in a bread bowl but they ran out. The soup also came with the most creamy, yummy, mashed potatoes with chunky bacon bits!

Order any beer because they are brewed to perfection and served in a large glass. Suits well with the Polish village-themed decorations, bartenders/waitresses in cultural dress and the savory, homey food. I also tried the honey wine which was an interesting, little bit sweet taste.

When we first arrived for dinner on a Saturday night, it would take at least a one hour but it was definitely worth the wait! The waitresses are super friendly and the host was very professional, direct and organized. At the end, if you pay with card, they will ask for the tip written before they swipe the cards (but feel free to leave a cash tip)!
