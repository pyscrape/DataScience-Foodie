This mom-and-pop shop serves the biggest, baddest bowls of poke I've seen since the poke craze hit NYC! 

For me, the poke bowl is less about the fish - although the quality of the fish and the marinade are still important - and more about the toppings. Simple truly delivers with a wonderful variety of toppings that come with every poke bowl, from fresh guacamole to edamame to purple and green wakame. Everything was delicious! I'd knock off a half star for the quality of the fish though. I'm not sure if it is the cuts of fish themselves or the way the sashimi cubes are prepared, but my tuna had quite a bit of tendon (? the white stringy stuff) in it which made it difficult to chew thoroughly. Otherwise, the entire bowl was extremely enjoyable and we devoured everything!

The cafe itself is very small, but there's quite a bit of seating. It just requires some careful maneuvering. Thankfully, they do a great (and polite) job of getting people to finish up their food and relinquish their seats so that it didn't take long for us to grab seats after our food was ready, even during peak dinner hours. 

I can't wait to be back to try the bento boxes or another poke bowl!
