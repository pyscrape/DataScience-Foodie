Amazing traditional polish food - such a hidden gem! I usually wouldn't think to try Polish food as 90% of the people I hang out with are Asian, but my co-workers took me here for lunch and this has become one of my favorite restaurants in New York!

Restaurant has a rustic atmosphere with wooden tables and benches, with the waitresses dressed in traditional dresses. 

Lunch specials are such a great value - Lunch Plate with Soup at only $10.50 and the portions are huge. I love the White borscht soup - which comes with mashed potatoes on the side. My kind of food!  There are about 6-7 lunch dishes to choose from. I really enjoyed the Stuffed cabbage with Polish kielbasa or 3 pierogis, and Polish kielbasa with hunter stew. So flavorful and tasty!  Can be a little heavy for lunch - but they provide boxes if you want to pack the rest to go. 

Outside of the lunch options I recommend the plate of barbecue for two or three people - it is a meat lover's heaven! It comes with (Sausage, white sausage, black pudding, pork, skewers of chicken and pork, salmon, chicken breast, bacon) and only for $27 total! I couldn't believe it. Portions were huge - enough to feed a family of 4. I loved everything!

Everything here is a good value, but best of all, the food is amazingly delicious. Highly recommend!
