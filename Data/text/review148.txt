I like it here. With the exception of one irritating customer service issue, I have been a long time fan. Their food is inventive and fun while maintaining classic flavors. I love the mussels with sausage and red sauce they used to serve. If they bring that back, I'd go everyday. Ha!

But the wine list, the food... it's all delicious. It's a good place to check out, nice patio and great location.
