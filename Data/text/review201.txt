When I heard about Emmer & Rye's dim sum cart service, I was a little apprehensive, fearing cultural misappropriation with a side of pretentiousness. My fears were unwarranted because the concept totally worked: the food was delicious (with one minor misstep of an overly salted pork shoulder), the waitstaff was knowledgeable yet not a bit snooty, and the overall meal experience was a standout in a sea of ever-increasing high-end dining options around town.

Because the menu is always changing, I won't go into great detail about what we ordered with the exception of the cacio e pepe, a particularly well-executed version of this culinary darling, and the salted caramel panna cotta, which was paired with crunchy honeycomb and pecan granola for one amazing dessert. As far as quantity goes, our server recommended that two of us order 3-5 menu items, including the sweet course, to allow room for a few of the bites that made the rounds on the aforementioned dim sum carts. We ordered four dishes and only tried one dim sum because our small plates were surprisingly generous and filling.

A nice touch: For special occasions, they place a signed note card at your table to greet you upon arrival.
