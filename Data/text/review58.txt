Yes, it's ANOTHER pok place...... but aside from 45th stop n shop, I haven't been too impressed with many of the other places that have opened. But gopok is worth trying! This is as close to Hawaiian poke here in Seattle as you'll get.

What I like about this place is the wide variety of flavors & toppings to pick from. And there's dessert options!!! 

You can build your own pok bowl with different sizes. Their king size bowl is HUGE btw. I got one so I could take left overs home and it was like 2 bowls in one, for only an extra $5.

My first time here I got the spicy salmon and classic ahi. Normally, I'm not a fan of tuna around here because it's usually lean and too <adj> rubbery </adj>. This tuna was actually <adj> good </adj>! I really liked the classic flavor with the soy sauce and sesame oil. Their spicy pok also actually has a kick to it (none of this sriracho mayo nonsense) and if you're not a fan spicy, I wouldn't get this one. Overall, I think the flavor profile here is a lot stronger and less sweet like other pok places I've tried. Which depending on your preference, you may or may not like. In my case, I loved it!

Also yes, get the dole whip! Very <adj> refreshing </adj> and tastes like how it is in Hawaii :)
