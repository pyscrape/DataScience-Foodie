Being a meat eater, Polish chow obviously appeals to my inner primordial european ancestry. This place packs a tasty wallop while providing exceptional value especially for lunch. 

The white borsch is divine, wonderfully complex with a touch of dill in a medium bodied base, toss in half an egg and plenty of Polish ham with a side of potatoes with bacon and it's on. The tripe soup is bold and filled with plenty of cow stomach, so good for yours, if you like tripe you'll love it. Lunch specials such as stuffed cabbage with a sweet red sauce comes with soup at about $11 for a sizeable portion. I really dug  pork hocks, gnawing off the bone with the soft skin a top the moist flesh beneath. The cabbage and Hunters stew were quite tasty, but being cooked in red wine lends to a sweeter taste then I've become accustomed to, good, but perhaps a bit too sweet. Unfortunately dinner plates can be in the upper $20's. As afore mentioned reviews all portions are large, you will not leave hungry.

Definitely an old world feel with dated walls and pics scattered about. A stuffed crow sits upon the beer taps, specializing with several exceptional Polish brews @ $7, a lil over priced.  I wonder if the poor crow poached the wrong cooks garden, forever jailed upon the brass handles for gawker stares as beer after beer passes beneath it's beak. Now that would be torture.

When in this diminishing Polish area in Brooklyn do yourself a favor and  pop in for a quick brew and some wonderfully tasty  bites.
