We wanted to drive in the city for a nice Italian dinner date, my husband and I. And I came across this spot, I'm a picky eater so I chose this out of a few other options. 

What won me over was the fact they have happy hour all day! Only on the food list, not the "featured dishes." 

We walked in, the ambience looked so lovely, intimate, and sweet. It's perfect for date night or a nice night out with friends. The people knew I was deaf because I obviously was signing, the bartender was so attentive and nice. 
The waiter was so sweet! I loved her style, too bad I never got her name. The staff was so nice, we sat at the bar for a bit and when one of the tables cleared up, they sat us down at the table immediately. They even carried our drinks over! Great staff. 


We ordered four different dishes, like the grilled octopus salad with citrus emulsion. 
I have to say, that was the BEST octopus I've ever had. I'm a fan of octopus and this was cooked perfectly! It was great to share with my husband too, you will not regret this order. 

Top sirloin steak with feta riccola salad, that was So good. I loved loved this. I only wish they had more steak but that's okay, it was seriously the bomb dotcom. The feta cheese was amazing too, the salad... YUM. 

My husband ordered the gnocchi rose and he loved it. I'm not a fan of gnocchi in general, but the taste was delicious. 

He also ordered the mussels with bread, the broth was AMAZING. The waiter even came back and asked us if we wanted complimentary bread to dip the broth in. I was like YES please. Needless to say, we definitely swallowed up every bit of our four meals. 

Come for happy hour! The trip from Bothell was so worth it. 

Next time I'm visiting Seattle, I'll definitely come back here and I highly recommend this to anyone who is visiting from out of town or even any Seattle local!
