The lady by the counter was friendly and informative. I wanted something not cold to drink besides coffee so I ordered a bottle of tea. She literally went out of the way to the basement to get me a non refrigerated bottle of tea. Now that is true customer service. I had no idea she was going to do that. Ordered a salmon poke bowl on quinoa. Ingredients were definitely fresh. It was interesting with corn flakes and quinoa since it gave it texture/crunch to the salmon. It also has an Asian touch to the dish. Cute little shop with communal table. Would be even better if they had a bigger hot drink selection. Wish I had the chance to try the bento box. Maybe next time when I'm in the area. It is a bit out of the way from where I'm usually hanging in Chinatown.
