List is great for happy hour which I believe ends at 6:30! It's a quaint restaurant, there will be some wait. More intimate setting and not great for parties larger than 5. Very modern with chandelier fixtures, dim lighting and damask walls. The service is considerably okay with some waving down for attention. Food does come out quickly! 

Quality of food-the gnocchi is what they're know for and it was delicious! We also tried the shrimp wrapped in bacon, which I loved. And the calamari was way too salty for its own good. We only had a few bites. Menu is extensive and prices are definitely a happy thought.
