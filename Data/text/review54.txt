goPok, goPok, goPok!

With the recent influx of pok joints in the area, I've been on a mission to try them all. So far, goPok wins, thanks to their <adj> generously </adj> cut fish, quality, freshness, and marinated flavor.

Boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon, were <adj> warmly </adj> greeted, and given samples of every pok available. Our favorites were the spicy tako, classic ahi, and the spicy aioli ahi. We <adj> absolutely </adj> loved the fact that everything was marinated well, and bursting with classic hawaiian pok flavors. The customizable joints ain't got nothin' on this place. Throw all the sauces you want on your fish, but you just can't compete with marinated pok. 

At $11 for a regular (1 pok), $13 for a large (2 pok), and $18 for a king-size (more pok), bowls are slightly pricey, but worth it. We shared a king-size bowl, which was generously filled with rice, classic & spicy aioli ahi, edamame, krab salad, seaweed salad, masago, pickled ginger, and topped off with crispy shallots, garlic, and furikake. Since it was a cold day, we were also given <adj> complimentary </adj> bowls of miso soup to warm us up, which was a nice touch.

Family owned and operated, goPok is pretty much pok perfection up in the PNW.
