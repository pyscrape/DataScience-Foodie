I was getting brunch with a bunch of friends who were all coming from different directions. In need of a location easy for everyone to get to, Second Bar and Kitchen popped up on Yelp. This restaurant is part of a hotel, so you instantly get the swanky, trendy feel. We all sat outside and brunched to our tummy's delight.

Sometimes, when I go out for brunch and yogurt is on the menu as a side or appetizer, the portion is often large enough to be totally filling for my breakfast needs. Seeing this place had grilled pineapple and strawberry salad (which came with yogurt), I thought it would be the same. The waiter warned me the portion is small...like an actual appetizer portion, so I asked if I could make it a double, and double it they did! It was great, fresh, sweet, and doubling the portion was an excellent idea. My friend who ordered the Texas benedict was one happy camper, as was the person who ordered the breakfast plate. Other things heard around the table: black truffle grits are great, coffee is bottomless, and get your latte with 2% milk.

Overall, we had a great time here and the perfect outdoor dining weather certainly helped!
