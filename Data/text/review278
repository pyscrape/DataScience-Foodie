OH F**K YEAH.


Is the only phrase I can describe Kichin. It's been quite awhile since I got excited about food. Now I waltzed my way in here after a happy hour so my memory/feeling of the food might be superfluous. I blame the one too many Brooklyn lagers I've had.

It's been awhile since I've seen employees actually give a shit about their food. I ordered the spicy salmon nigiri (rice ball). My spicy salmon rice ball was handcrafted with such love and care. The amazing man (God bless him) made my onigiri in less than 45 seconds, inspected it and then wrapped it so perfectly. The man in the front of house lovingly poured some amazing red sauce in a cup to go as well. This is the type of joint where you take your shit to go and make your way home so you can stuff your face like an animal. Seating is present but very limited. My spicy salmon rice ball was cooked perfectly and stuffed with soooo much salmon. Perfectly cooked salmon. The fish was moist and delicate. The way salmon should ALWAYS be cooked. It was spicy but in a flavorful manner. Not overpowering. Very filling.  

Words cannot explain the happiness I feel from eating their food. I am so happy I only live 3 blocks away from Kichin. Now if they delivered, half my paycheck would probably go to eating here. My only regret is that I only ordered a spicy salmon rice onigiri and I wish I was hungrier and tried more stuff.
