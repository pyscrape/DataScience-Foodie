Buyer beware - Simple is not a restaurant. It's more of a take out and to-go place, since there are no bathrooms and space is tight.

Anyhow, I guess I was a little underwhelmed by Simple. Their bowls, are in fact, not very simple at all - I got the salmon poke bowl and it was in overladen with toppings - I much prefer Pokeworks' simpler premade options, or better yet, the option to pick and choose your toppings. The food is indeed fresh, so no problems with that.
