Without a doubt, List has THE best Happy Hour deal that I have ever come across! Although the restaurant exudes a much smaller and intimate setting, they still managed to accommodate our loud group of 8 without a hitch.

I honestly can't find anything wrong about each and every dish we ordered. From the grilled octopus salad to the black truffle gnocchi--everything was amazing! 

However, the dish that surpassed all our expectations and won everyone's hearts (and tummies) was the grilled Chilean sea bass. How can the skin be so crispy and flavorful yet the fish itself be so moist and indulgent!? I enjoyed eating this dish because every piece was as succulent and so creamy as the last.

Since we were served tapas-style, our hungry group doubled on all orders. Being shy and stingy was NOT an option at our table. All drinks guzzled down and all plates ravishingly devoured...nothing left but exhausted livers and overstuffed tummies.

Surprisingly, for a group of 8 that ordered more than 12 dishes AND several rounds of drinks--our bill was under $250 (excluding tip). Nothing beats a night filled with gluttony and debauchery while surrounded by a crazy bunch of starving alcoholics.

Well done, List...well done =)
