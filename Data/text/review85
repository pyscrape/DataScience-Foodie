While I was looking for something light and easy digest, I came across this place through Yelp. The reviews seem pretty nice and the photos looked amazing so I decided to give this place a try. I got spicy tuna poke bowl ($10) and while it is definitely a lot pricier than most dishes in Chinatown, the portion was huge and healthier (less oily). I wouldn't say the fish was super fresh but it was definitely decent with other vegetables. I would come back if I'm craving poke bowl again!
