Came here for a date night and I absolutely loved it! Boyfriend did a great job picking out the place. It's super cute inside and the drinks look so pretty. We couldn't get a reservation for 2 so we had to sit by the bar and entertained ourselves with a few drinks for the first 30 minutes. The mule in the copper cup was strong and I preferred the Magner cider over the pineapple sculpin IPA.

The ahi tuna salad was my favorite dish of the night. It was a decent size portion and it was crusted with black and white sesame seeds outer layering. Pork sliders were delicious and the meatball lollipop were juicy! I really missed poutine from Montreal so we decided to order it here. It wasn't exactly the same to compare, but it was okay. They used mozzarella cheese instead of cured cheese and the gravy wasn't as thick as I expected. Some sausages on top would have made a world of wonder. But overall, loved the service and the ambiance.
