I came here last week for a late holiday work dinner and had an incredible time. My coworker knew a friend of the owners, so everyone made sure to come by and say hi, which was very sweet. We started with a few appetizers (like the sunchokes, Buretta cheese and homemade bread and a few others) and a bottle of Sav Blanc - well actually make that too!

The dim sum cart was so fun! They come around every so often after you place your main order and bring by fresh appetizers, which are a total surprise. We had oysters, tuna tartare, empanadas I believe, and a few others. Keep in mind that you'll have at least 3-5 options for additional pieces of apps, but all the portions are very small. It's hard to decide what to order when you don't know what's coming around, but it all worked out. 

For dinner we tried the beef short ribs and loved them!! It came with the most divine pancake/naan bread and had to order more of the bread because it was so good. We had some pasta and a few other dishes and loved it all. 

After all the courses we were STILL hungry (the entrees are pretty small and can only be shared for 1-2 people) so we ordered FOUR desserts. Loved the twist on the lemon meringue dish, the Pannacota and honey comb dish, and ginger ice cream sandwich. I didn't really enjoy the ice cream and blueberry pure (can't recall all ingredients).

After all four desserts we were finally full and left happy!! Will be back for a date night soon!
