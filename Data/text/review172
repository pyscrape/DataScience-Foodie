Goodness, what a place. Coming in, I didn't expect such a top-notch experience at Barley Swine. We got to sit right in front of the kitchen, front-row seats to the constant hustle and bustle of line cooks and sous chefs working the floor.

In order of what was served...

Grilled Strawberries
Definitely an interesting texture take on strawberries with snap pea and chevre. I was a fan.

Pig Skin Noodles
These were quite good, with an added kick from the hot sauce blended with shrimp and scallops. I could've eaten a giant bowl of these.

Grilled Carrot
A nicely prepared dish - not one of the standouts, but definitely tasty.

Poached Red Snapper
You cannot go wrong with koji butter, no matter what you do. Pair this decadent koji butter with a perfect piece of poached red snapper and you have an extraordinarily savory, delicious dish.

Parley Croissant
Quite, quite good. The bone marrow has more of a foie gras-like texture but still butter, rich and so, so good. The Parsley Croissant was flaky and delectable. 

Blackened Octopus
Another great dish. The pork fried rice was amazing. The octopus was well flavored and nicely tender.

Fried Chicken
Like candy, with its skin coated with smoked fish caramel. The pickles were a nice touch.

Duck
This was the one dish that I expected just a bit more from. Definitely a great piece of duck, but could have been a bit softer. Beet and strawberry were great additions though.

Grapefruit Sorbet
Extremely refreshing, with the combination of jasmine and beet. Mmmm.

Peanut Monte Blanc
Seeing this on the menu, I was a little worried that this would be really sweet - with ingredients like honey, dark chocolate and ginger - but it was absolutely perfect. A little nutty, a little crunchy. So good.

It's a dinner that will take up most of your evening - it lasted roughly 2.5 hours - but it was really quite nice. The service was great and the food... so worth it.
