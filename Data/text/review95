Small place with friendly service, cute decorations and very reasonably-priced food. I had the salmon poke bowl with quinoa as the base and sunflower seeds for the crunch.  The quinoa was sprouted and perfectly cooked and the salmon and vegetable were yummy and fresh.  I brought a potato croquette back for my boyfriend, and that was a very tasty treat. I love that this is conveniently located just a block from the Grand Street train stop, and I look forward to making this a regular stop for a healthy and filling meal (oh yeah, portions are generous, too).
