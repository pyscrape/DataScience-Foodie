This is definitely not your typical Thai place, and you won't find your usual pad thai or colorful curries on their menu. Instead, you get stir fries loaded with flavor from a variety of authentic Thai spices and ingredients. I went on a really warm afternoon, so starting off with a Thai iced tea definitely hit the spot. Also, it was pretty busy, and since the two owners take all the orders and do all the cooking, it took a bit of while for the orders to come. Good food takes time, so I didn't mind the wait. But be prepared in case you're looking for something quick.

My friend and I went with the Pad Ka Pow and Tofu Stir-Fry (the Om Gai  and few other items were unavailable). I don't have the highest spice tolerance, so the Pad Ka Pow definitely got the sweat and sniffles going, especially since it was about 95 degrees outside. The basil and cucumber slices helped, but I could only get about halfway through the order before waving the white flag. The Tofu was much milder and came with a beautiful variety of fresh veggies, which exemplifies the pride and effort they put into preparing their food. I do wish they had a few additional menu items, especially since some things were sold out or unavailable when I visited, but I do look forward to coming back.
