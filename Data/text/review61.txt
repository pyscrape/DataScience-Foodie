Thursday Kitchen truly is the perfect name for such a unique, <adj> whimsical </adj> restaurant. Everyone goes out for dinner on the weekend, but there is something to be said about a dining experience or even a dinner plan on a Thursday. And that unique... unicorn quality is something that Thursday Kitchen definitely emanates from the light-up Capri-Thursday cocktails to the beautifully envisioned Korean interpretations of tapas.

I'm going to be honest, the thing that dragged my lazy Californian butt out to the East Village from Midtown on the snowiest day of the winter so far, and queue for almost an hour to get a seat, was the menu. And I promise you... it was worth it. 

When we finally sat down, our waitress recommended we have 2 tapas each in order for it to be filling. She was right - I would highly recommend ordering to that ratio. It seems small, but the timing at which the food comes out makes it a very <adj> satisfying </adj> meal. Overall, the breakdown of the menu between "Starch, Veggies, Meat, Seafood" made it a very easy menu to navigate and make our decisions.
