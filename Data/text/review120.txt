Wow! Can't wait to go back to List! Happy Hour is a MUST! Food is made for sharing but can easily be the size of an individual entre. I highly recommend sharing so you can try more items.

We started off with the grilled octopus, not overly cooked with a nice char. Second course was the calamari followed by the gnocchi! We ordered a 2nd round of gnocchi because we liked it so much.  I really had no complaints, great atmosphere, delicious food and good service = WIN.

Highly recommend!
