Wait. How is it possible I haven't reviewed List yet? Remedying this stat!

List has one of the best happy hours around, with quality food and reasonably priced bottles of wine. I've been here a number of times and ALWAYS order the gnocchi, no matter what. They're light, pillowy, and smothered in that delicious black truffle cream sauce. As for the rest of the menu, you really can't go wrong. Just close your eyes, point, and order whatever your finger lands on.
