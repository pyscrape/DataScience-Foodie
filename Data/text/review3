I just found their pics in my camera roll and now I'm in full CRAVE mode.  This is Sway level Thai on a food truck level.  That being the ultimate compliment as Sway is my favorite restaurant on the globe. Yes, globe.  Dee Dee is far from me but I make sure to come here EVERY time I go to the airport.  And EVERY time it's consistently amazing.  I've had many dishes so I don't need to outline protocol for you listing things to avoid, they are all 4+ stars.  But I will tell you their signature dish with the fried egg is LIGHTS OUT.  I have taken no less than 5 people here and that dish we all agree is SHUT IT DOWN, PARTY IS OVER good! Join me in CRAVE mode and eat all the things here.
