I have been here on multiple occasions and each time is better than the last. 

THE DRINKS
Cheap Sapporo beer - $3
Cocktails in plastic bags with light up ice cubes - <adj> Refreshing </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj> - $9  
I recommend the Ms. Cuteini if you like refreshing cucumber drinks. 

THE FOOD
Here is what I recommend: Avocado is a light appetizer that is so simple, but <adj> amazingly delicious </adj> . Pork belly taco. Crispy Chicken. Steak (melts in your mouth like butter). Truffle Mac and Cheese. Kimchi Paella.

Our group was 4 people and 2 tapas per person was more than enough. 

If you want to avoid waiting for a table show up around 6pm when it opens. If you can't get there at 6, wait until 9pm when the dinner crowd dies down. Earlier in the week is less crowded. If you show up at 7:30 on a Friday evening expect to wait about an hour.
