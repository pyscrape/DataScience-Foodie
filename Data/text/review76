Other than the fact that there's light up adult Capri sun here, there's really nothing else here....that is good. Perhaps the crispy pork belly and the tacos but the other items on the menu is a no no. 

Do not get the sweet potato fries unless you wanna eat uncooked fries. The truffle Mac and cheese was too strong, I wouldn't say it was good nor bad but it did not wow me. The only thing good was the tacos and the crispy pork belly. It would have been even better if it wasn't too salty. The strawberry soju is definitely better than the rest. It taste sweet and looks pretty. I think people come here because of the soju not so much for the food. The menu selection was also limited. I wish you can order the soju for take out but you cannot take the light up ice cubes home. 

The wait time was also ridiculous when it just opened. The place is very dim with very  tight and packed seatings.
