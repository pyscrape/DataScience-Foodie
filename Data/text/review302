Great cozy and loud spot for a quick drink and tapas. Located in a basement on Orchard street. Came here to meet some friends for pre-dinner drinks. They tucked us in a nice little corner near the back. 

Drinks: Tried the Hibiscus Royale - All made with their house-made syrups. The drink ran on the sweet side, but was still delicious regardless

Tapas: Baked Portobello with garlic, bread crumbs, olive oil and herbs - 3 pieces to an order, and this was just absolutely delicious. I am always a fan of stuffed mushrooms, and these were generous sized portobello caps cooked perfectly. The stuffing was not mushy or overly crunchy. Loved this dish!

Sea scallop carpaccio with salmon caviar, yuzu, and spices - Less than impressed with this dish. The salmon caviar was too overpowering and took away from the delicate flavor of the sea scallop. The yuzu and spices were great, but unfortunately still overpowered by the salmon caviar. We didn't enjoy this dish as much.

Service: Was amazing! The wait staff were so friendly, attentive, and fun! They made sure since we sat near the A/C-Heating unit that we felt comfortable with the temperature and always adjusted it to our needs. Loved this place for its ambiance and drinks, and though we only tried two dishes, we would love to come back and try more on the menu!
