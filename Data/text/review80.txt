I remember I came here one Sunday afternoon last year during their first stages of soft-opening. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was going to be a poke place open in Chinatown. 

When my party stepped in, we were treated with nothing but the highest form of respect. The owners even took the time to explain what everything was and even brought our orders to our tables for us. I settled for the ahi tuna bowl and it was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and it appeared that they put in a lot of effort into my order. What really hit me was how surprisingly cheap everything was. My bowl didn't cost more than $12 and I was still satisfied with the quality. What also made this place stand out was the interior of the venue. Felt more like a cafe than a poke restaurant. There definitely was a homey feel to it. 

What really topped off our experience here was that they owner even presented us with a complimentary raindrop cake at the end. That was a 
Big plus! 

Overall my experience here was admirable and I'll definitely be back in the future.
