Best poke I've had in NYC yet. The spicy tuna is delicious - huge pink chunks on a bed of white rice (my choice) and strips of ginger, wonton chips and more tasty things.

The bubble tea was the biggest letdown - very cotton candy-sweet, like they poured tons of syrup in it. Did not taste like fresh tea. Would not recommend!

But the poke? A creamy, savory bowl of healthy deliciousness. 

4 stars!
