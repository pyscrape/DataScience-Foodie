Was at REI and wanted to try tapas in Seattle for the first time. Found this place on Yelp.

Pros:
- Excellent service
-- The 3 bartenders were doing work! Hustling, cleaning, doing dishes, making drinks and running plates constantly.
- The decor. The finishes in this place are gorg. The metal ceiling, skylights, and the bubble photos on the walls... Very ritzy and well thought-out. 
- Everything we ordered was delicious.
-- King Salmon. Nutty, spicy and fresh.
-- Gnocci. The sauce and mushrooms on this are heaven.
-- Shrub and... Blackberry? Hubby loved it!
-- Cucumber water

Cons:
- The noise in the back patio. I felt like my ears would start bleeding, and if they hadn't had a place for us at the far end of the bar, we would've left. This is not a place to go for an intimate date night.
