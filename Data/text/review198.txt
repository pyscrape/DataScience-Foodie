I think there is enough said about this place. We stood in the line for about 45 mins in the rain to eat the best bowl of pasta outside Italy. And we will do it again!
We ordered the bread, kale salad, the lasagne and the gigli. They customized an order for our 5 yr old. A bottle of wine. That says it all! In love!
