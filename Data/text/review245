I've been craving to try this place! Came here for happy hour with some friends and we ordered up a storm. Tried the following items:

Half dozen oysters ($7): Great quality, comes with a side of horseradish and a vinegar sauce that both complemented it well, very fresh!
Herb & Bitter Salad ($7): We were craving some healthy fresh salad but it was slightly on the salty side. Could have tasted way better without as much salt.
Gambas al Ajillo ($9): The shrimp portions were extremely generous and it was very tasty. Comes with a side of bread which helps complement the different spices the shrimp are cooked in
Wild Boar meatballs with mole sauce ($9): I honestly think that was my least favorite dish, we could have done without this one. The meatballs weren't very tender and were very generic, the sauce was ok but wasn't anything special
Calamari (not part of happy hour): boy were these delicious, we ended up getting 3 servings for the table, that's how much we loved it! But how can you go wrong with fried calamari!

Drinks: We absolutely LOVED their drinks. The bartenders here are fabulous and the custom make drinks based on what tastes you enjoy. I do enjoy myself a bourbon sour from time to time and i requested it with bullet and they made it to complete perfection.

Overall, I can definitely say I will be coming back!
