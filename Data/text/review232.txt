I had a Groupon and since we were craving Italian, we decided to try this place out. 
The Groupon was for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, a split dessert and a wine valued up to $40 for $89. It was a great deal.
We ordered the calamari and rice balls for apps. The calamari was a bit greasy for my liking but it was still filling and the three sauces that it came with was good. I loved the rice balls. It had cheese and it came with a meat sauce. Outside of the deal we ordered oysters and split a cesar salad. The oysters were good and it came with a sauce that just tasted like Tabasco. It would've been nice if they had a mignonette sauce for them. The Cesar was good. 
We also ordered the lobster ravioli but the bacon overpowered the lobster. The sauce was good though. 
We ordered the grass fed steak and The crab and shrimp pasta. They were great servings! We were too full to eat at this point. 
We topped it off with a bottle of Syrah! Which was nice. 
For dessert we had the creme brle, vanilla and espresso. Unfortunately, this was a fail for us. We like the crispy too layer and char taste that it usually has but this place didn't deliver that. 
The service was really great but the food is mediocre. Something was always kind of missing. I don't think we would be coming back without a Groupon. I wish this place well though. It has potential.
