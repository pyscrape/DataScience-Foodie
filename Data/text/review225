Vino Santo is a great little Italian spot on busy Lincoln Ave. in Willow Glen.  I made reservations through open table for 5, just to make sure we'd be able to get a table right away.  We were sat right in the front next to the fragrant Christmas tree.  

We shared a bottle of wine, the wine was pretty good, obviously marked up a lot more than it should have been, but oh well, I wanted wine.  I started off with the Caesar salad and it was served as a wedge and the dressing was very delicious! For main course I got the sausage ravioli, it was very delicious.  Little pillows of sausage filled ravioli with with pancetta, and a butter, sage sauce. So good. 

Our service was alright throughout the night, our waiter checked in on us once we got our food, but it seemed that the other tables may have been more interesting to him because it was rare we got our water glasses filled and we didn't get more bread when we had asked for it.  Since we were up in the front of the small restaurant, there was a room divider that was right next to our table and it fell, twice.  The first time my friend noticed in time to stop it, then the second time it just bam! landed flat on the hostess stand.  It just was a very odd experience, I know we didn't do anything wrong, but it felt like we were treated as we had done something wrong.  

Lastly, there was 5 of us, and a child.  The kid didn't eat, she had a piece of bread, we didn't order her a meal.  We got our bill and it included automatic 20% gratuity!  I'm guessing it's because there is "6 total" but I didn't see anywhere on the menu where a stated that a 20% gratuity would be added for parties of "x" or more.  It's not that I didn't want to tip our waiter, but I don't think it should have been added in for me without my knowledge.  

I may come to Vin Santo again if I really want Italian and I just happen to be on Lincoln, but nothing really jumped out at me as being something I absolutely had to come back for.
