A hella small and intimate spot. The whole restaurant probably seats about 30 people. The tables are close together and possibly about 10 bar seats. It was hard to find someone to put our name on a wait list. Finally a staff member helps us, however, I believe she was a server and a hostess. We came for a table of six and it was difficult to wait for seating because of the small location. Tip: It's probably a better with a table of two to four people.

Note: Happy hour all day Sunday and Monday. $3.99 for a glass of red or white (ask yer bartender). $15 for a bottle. Happy hour extends to food or drink.

This spot is a tapas shared plates kinda restaurant, where everything is meant to be shared (probably one plate for 3-4 people)

What we ordered:
Gnocchi rose
Beef shoulder tenderloin steak with fries
Grilled octopus salad with citrus emulsion -yes must try. Tender and so flavorful
Handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream - good ordered another
Sea salt and pepper calamari - it was ok. Standard fare with a garlic aioli. 
Local fresh clams with Chardonnay broth and crostini (out of it) Boo! We really wanted to try it.
Grilled Chilean sea bass - meh, not too much going on 
Wild mushroom pure soup - so good highly recommended
Seared ahi tuna fillet and honey ginger sauce - meh, ahi was too well done/dry.
Chicken with mushroom - dry.

Between six people... It was good except with the inconsistency. Our first rounds were amazing where when we ordered an encore round, it was really disappointing. The drink was not as good, octopus was chewy rather than tender. Slight disappointment there.

Ambivalence: You can see the kitchen from the bar area. Loved the red lighting on the bar.

I'd come back, but probably in a smaller group.

Parking is street, metered.
