For a 1.5 hour wait in the freezing cold outside, I expected my mind to be blown. The line was down the block around 12:30 on a Friday, and we thought it must be good! They only serve three pastas a day, at $9 each. The day we went the menu had pappardelle bolognese, pasta mista (had goat cheese) and baked mafalda. We ordered one of each and an extra pappardelle because it's one of my favorite pastas. The pappardelle was the most disappointing. The sauce was incredibly salty and the pasta was raw in the center. The baked mafalda was not too bad, it had loads of veggies in it and was very soft. The pasta mista was the best of the bunch. I expected not to like it because I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but it tasted like regular cheese. 

TL;DR: Not worth the wait. And there are definitely better pasta places (but with a bigger price tag).
