We discovered Second Bar during a recent trip to Austin and were surprised to find that the open-air, dog-friendly patio was relatively uninhabited on a sunny Saturday afternoon. You can find plenty of free street parking nearby on weekends. Our waitress was pretty quirky, but the service was smooth for the most part. They did forget to add bacon to my girlfriend's sandwich, but were apologetic and promptly brought us some on the side.

We ordered Bloody Marys to start, and I was impressed both by how they managed to be spicy without the usual bitterness and by how they were $7. A popular brunch place with cocktails for under $12? Unheard of. I went with the Black and Bleu pizza, which was mind-numbingly good and highly recommended if you are a fan of bold, unusual flavors. The pungency of the cheese and red onions accentuated the contrast between the sugary dates and salty pork belly. Unfortunately, my girlfriend found her sandwich (the Breakfast Club, with scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato) fairly plain, so I dropped the rating from a 5 to a 4. The Black Truffle Grits were likewise bland, although I am a self-proclaimed grits hater...I don't get the appeal. My suggestion would be to go for some of their off-beat options rather than the run-of-the-mill brunch bites, since they seem to excel more in this arena.
