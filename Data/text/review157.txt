Went here last night and had the BEST experience! We sat at the bar even though there was only a 25 minute wait at 9 on a Friday night (which amazed us!)

The bar staff was so amazing, suggested the best drinks to order and were beyond friendly and knowledgeable of other places to visit while we were here in Austin from Omaha. Being from Omaha expectations for a good steak are pretty high, and I was in heaven. Devoured my flank steak (medium rare) way too fast but it was so delicious I couldn't help it! Paired perfectly with my bourbon drink ;) Thank you to Taylor, Kenny and damn it I'm sorry but I forgot the name of the bartender who helped us most of all but everything was amazing. Great conversations, amazing food, quick and great service. We'll be back when we visit again!
