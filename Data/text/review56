Seattle has gotten the pok bug and if you're trying to figure out which one to try, you should definitely try this one. I can tell you which ones to avoid, but what's the point? You might as well just try the ones I tell you to (:

They have a ton of options- their own creations or make your own. Salmon, ahi, tofu, tako, etc. I decided to get the 12th man bowl because I love spicy and I love salmon. You can make it into a salad, rice bowl, or a burrito. I went bowl- white rice, spicy salmon, spicy ahi, classic salmon. Seaweed salad, krab salad, edamame, masago, fried shallots, cucumber, and avocado (and yes, it's extra, and yes, it's worth it every single time) and a little extra spicy mayo on the side. I loved it. Good size portions and flavourful. Fishies were a good size and I was definitely full afterwards. Though, like 45th (which I've mentioned before...I get it, broken record, however...), I wish they seasoned their rice and it wasn't warm, but still try this place. Afterwards, we decided on dole whip. Do not skip out on it. And the homemade mochi ice cream. Basically- don't skip out on this place.
