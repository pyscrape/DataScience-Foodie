Emmer and Rye was sent from heaven by angels to give us peasants the best meal of our lives.  This place is IT.

During a weekend trip to beautiful Austin, my friend and I made a reservation at Emmer.  We were offered seats at the chefs table and I'm SO glad we took them.  The well-oiled machine that comprises the Emmer experience is fascinating and friendly. 

Oh the food...the food *heart eye emoji*.  I'm convinced you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  We ordered a bunch of small dishes, including the pork belly, burratta, and some kind of cheesy pasta that was to die for.  Everything was just delectable!  

Honestly, I would fly to Austin just for another meal at Emmer and Rye.  It was THAT good.
