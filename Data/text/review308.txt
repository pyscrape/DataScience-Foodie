This is a great tapas place! They give you lots of bread that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with your meal. We ordered the steak tartare, fig and goat cheese tartines, duck rillettes, and butterfly salmon. The steak tartare was definitely the highlight of everything we ordered. The meat tastes fresh and has a nice mild flavor. The fig and goat cheese tartines were amazing except for the bread that was a little bit tough and chewy. I have never had duck rillettes before but after having this one, I will definitely try more! The butterfly salmon was okay, nothing to write home about.

I also ordered blue cocktail (I don't remember the name of it but it had something to do with a lady in a blue dress.) The server drink served me the drink with a back story which I thought was pretty cool. The cocktail was fruity, sweet, and delicious. 

Service could use a little bit of work. We were sat in the back of the restaurant and after our initial orders were brought out, our server slacked on refilling our water and it was hard to flag him down to make more orders.
