I'm so late to the party that it's not even funny. I definitely don't need to harp on how great this place is since 700+ others have already done so while I was living under a rock. 

But hello! Decor! Can whoever did the interior show me some tricks?! I loved everything about the entry way and how they used so many basic items to create such a boho-chic vibe. 

I also really loved sitting at the bar as the kitchen is open-concept. It was really cool to watch everyone at work!
