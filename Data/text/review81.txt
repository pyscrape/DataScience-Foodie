Come here for the poke bowls! Super fresh, packed with ingredients/add ons, so filling.
Unlike other poke places where you build your own bowl by choosing ingredients in an assembly line fashion, Simple has pre-made options, but all contain ingredients you would want anyways! 
You choose based on the protein, then decide what base and what extra crunchies you want to add. 
I assume they assemble their ingredients/sauces based on what they think goes best with the protein. Most are similar, with a few substitutes.

I've gotten the ahi tuna and the spicy tuna. Both are delicious! Ahi tuna comes with sliced tuna, vs. the spicy tuna is chunks. I love that they put MANGO!
They pack it with rice at the bottom, so it's very filling.

My only criticism is I wish it were sliced avocado, instead of mashed avocado. But still delicious!
Seating is pretty limited here, but we haven't had a problem the two times we came. You may just need to wait a little bit. It's easier in the summer when you can walk somewhere and eat outside. But for the winter months, it's best you wait. 

Definitely have to try their katsu. HUUUGE portions.
