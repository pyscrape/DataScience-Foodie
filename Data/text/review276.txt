This place hands-down had the best fried chicken that I have ever had. Such a perfectly seasoned and crunchy batter around their tender chicken pieces. It's an automatic 5* based on their chicken. Everyone needs to try it. I'll have dreams about it when I go back to Toronto. 

I also had a spicy salmon rice ball, which was good - came with a nice sauce. It was a little bit too much rice for my liking - but what else was I really expecting out of a rice ball? 

The bibimbap was good as well, it's hard to judge bibimbap because most places are fairly similar since it's the same ingredient and sauce. But really good pieces of beef in it.
