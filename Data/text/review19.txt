Pad Ka Pow? More like Pad Ka PERFECT! Ya'll don't even know how tasty and delicious their Pad Ka Pow is! It's got the kick that'll make you cry and the flavours that'll keep you coming back for more. Every time I go to Austin, their Pad Ka Pow is the ONLY THING ON MY MIND!

Their mango sticky rice is bomb AF too, but they ran out when we got there. THAT IS A SIGN OF HOW ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS IT IS.

No better place to get spicy food or authentic Thai food. 

TIP: Misquitos are everywhere. Be sure to use their bug spray when ordering or ask for a bug repellent candle. :)

TIP PT. 2: MAKE SURE YOU GET THEIR THAI TEA. You're welcome.
