We were introduced to Vin Santo yesterday thru a Groupon deal; both hubby and I enjoyed our dinner experience very much.  

Driving thru the tree lined Willow Glen neighborhood was nice, finding street parking was not too bad either on a weekday evening. Service was warm and friendly from making reservation throughout the entire dinner. We were greeted warmly upon entering the restaurant, a pleasant surprise to find a one man band / singer playing in the dining room.

Our waitress was very pleasant and patient, she explained the menu and how the groupon works. we picked our food based on my research of other yelp reviews.

The homemade bread was fresh and moist, not too crazy about the complimentary polenta, too much butter for our taste. We had the lobster croquet and Mediterranean salad as starters, salad was very fresh and lightly dressed, the croquet was OK, didn't taste the lobster   and kind of doughy.

our main dishes were the wild boar pasta and red snapper/shrimp pasta, both were delicious and very generously portioned including the amount of protein.  We ordered the only merlot from the list and found it quite good. Creme brulee was the dessert. We walked out happily with enough leftover for another meal.
