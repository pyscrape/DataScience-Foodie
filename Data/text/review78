I'm such a fan! There seems to be a recent surge of Korean-inspired tapas-style restaurants. Thursday Kitchen does not disappoint. 

The tapas dishes overall are delicious, with good portions and reasonable prices. You can't go wrong with any of the menu items. Couldn't say anything bad about any of the 8 dishes we ordered. Definitely like to highlight the truffle mac & cheese, soft shell crab, and chicken though. I was also wow'ed by the matcha bread dessert. Super delicious.

Service was the best I've received in ages. Despite their business, our cups of water were never empty. The staff was nice and attentive, and answered many questions for us.
