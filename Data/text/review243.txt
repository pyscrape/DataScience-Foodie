Nice place on broadway with tons of seating, either at the bar or a table. Tons of drink options ranging from cocktails (those primarily) to wine and beer. I just stuck with wine for the night. All of the dishes sound great and I have to say the mussels in the tomato-coconut sauce was definitely my favorite. Nice big plump mussels and the sauce was to die for. It comes with bread for dipping which could certainly be better bread but thankfully the sauce was so good I didn't care. The portions are all reasonable too. The website definitely needs to be updated though, the menu is not reflective of what is current option-wise or prices. Good service too!
