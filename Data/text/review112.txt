Ever wanted a drink after a show and wanted to swoon over cute Irish men with Irish accents? Yes, you've found the spot. They have a great cocktail program and have a lot of seats! Let's face it, that's always a good thing when you're trying to talk about the show you just saw with a friend and don't want to be speaking over your neighbor.

I've only been here for drinks and some nosh but with that, I'd recommend their whiskey cocktails, their beer (which they'll let you get a taste before you fully order it) and their warm pretzels. 

Also, as a bonus, one of them times I've been here they were holding a celebration for someone on Broadway. Maybe you'll sneak a peek at the person you just saw on stage! Unless you're on Broadway and wanted a quiet place for a meal after your show....then sorry I blew your cover.
