Not bad, I've tried just about everything on the menu, authentic Polish food for sure. Definitely the Disney Land of Polish restaurants so you'll have a crowd consistent with that. A landmark of the neighborhood everyone has to experience at least once, unless of course you have some kind of issue with eating meat. The steak tartar was one of my favorites which caused me to hallucinate overnight with sweats, an overall amazing experience.
