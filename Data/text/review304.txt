Came here because I read so much on their Royales. So of course, I tried the Hibiscus and Rose. Both were fresh and sweet, but not overbearing. The space is small (as anywhere in L.E.S.), but past the bar there are high tops with more room. We shared the 2-cheese plate (baguettes, grapes, walnuts) and the Country Liver Pat (baguettes, pickles). Both were great starters. Then came the beef sliders (2), which were so yummy. Just wish there had been at least one more for the $15 price tag. We finished up with the Croque Monsieur, which BY FAR was the best tasting and best bang for your buck. It's a traditional croque monsieur, cut into four generous pieces. I couldn't get enough. Service is sweet and simple. Would love to come back.
