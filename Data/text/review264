Such an awesome option for a quick lunch or dinner in the area, whether you're picking up or getting delivered ($20 minimum). There's not much else to choose from in that immediate area besides a McDonald's, a Dunkin Donuts, and a halal cart, so I was very grateful to find out about this relatively healthy Korean spot. 

The guys behind the counter are so helpful and friendly and they'll gladly make any recommendations if you're not sure where to start. I can never go wrong with a bowl, so that's where I typically end up, but the rice balls look amazing too. I suggest the bulgogi, grilled chicken, or salmon bowls, and don't forget to wash it down with their incredible honeydew white tea which they make in house. I was disappointed by their soggy and broken veggie dumplings and by the sauce that leaked all over the inside of my bag, but I'm willing to let it go because everything else I've had is so tasty. 

There's not much of a dining/sit-in area to speak of, but luckily most of their items are very portable and perfect for a grab and go situation. Even better, they sell Pocky Sticks at the counter - my favorite snack! 

I'm rooting for these guys as they seem to put a lot of heart into their food and I think it's a great addition to the Marcy stop block. Go check them out!
