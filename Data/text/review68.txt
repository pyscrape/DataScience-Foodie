Korean fusion tapas! 
This place is fairly small so be prepared to wait or come early. We came on a Tuesday night, and our party of 7 didn't have to wait tooo long. Maybe like 30 mins or so? There's a cash bar at the front though, so you can wait around here if you'd like!

My friend and I were excited about the capri-thursdays (hehh get it?) because why not?? LIGHT UP drinks?? obvi. 
We both got the lychee + mango one, and it was delicious! But totally hype. Had to use the "It's LIT" sticker on snapchat though! Always for the snap :p

Since we were a larger party, our waiter suggested ordering two of each dish we wanted, which was a great idea. 

I loved every single dish we got! 
-Octopus: DELICIOUS flavor. Slightly on the smaller side. The octopus is sliced very thinly and served chilled. Good appetizer

-Truffle mac and cheese: had to get this based on reviews! You can literally smell the truffle when you walk in the door. Very cheesy and ooey gooey. Truffle flavor lasted throughout the whole dish.

-Chicharron pork belly: our server told us this was cooked for FIVE HOURS. 5!! And it was definitely reflected in the taste, texture, everything. Super crispy on the outside, fatty and juicy underneath. One of my favorite dishes

-Kimchi paella: Hearty and filling! The kimchi flavor is balanced well with the cheese, and it's not too overbearing. Comes with three mussels and two shrimps! Very creamy and risotto-like

-Steak: cooked to perfection! So happy with this dish. It's also served with kale and grits. Also one of my favorite dishes because of how the steak was cooked and the flavors.

I love how each dish is served -- attention to detail is a strong suit here, and I really appreciate that! Our servers also explained each dish when they came out, which was helpful.
Definitely coming back to try everything else!
