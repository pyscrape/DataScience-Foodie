last night my girlfriend treated me to barley swine for veterans day. we frequent their sister location, Odd Duck, and we go to uchiko and uchi fairly often as well. I will be straightforward and get the negative things out of the way first.

 I was disappointed they weren't offering anything to veterans, and we should've just gone to odd duck, because they were offering a free burger.

Also, neither one of us to super excited about our cocktails, but the homemade soda was perfect (and it's something we get at odd duck every time as well).

But besides that, the food was absolutely excellent. Artistically presented, full of flavor, and perfectly cooked. we both enjoyed the duck the most, and while I initially thought the akaushi was over seasoned, the sweet corn puree hid that if you ate it together, which was the point.

All in all, 4/5 for the entire experience, but 5 for the food.
