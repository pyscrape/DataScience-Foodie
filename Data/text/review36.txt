It's just over rated for the price. I went to celebrate my birthday with a couple friends. I believe we ordered 4 courses and 2 additions. The course structure is such that each dish is like a main in that they are the same proportion. Most of the dishes were just ok. The main protein dish, which was duck literally had 4 pieces of breast meat, which imo were barely better than the ducks hanging in the window at Uwajimaya. There was also a milk poached meat dish that was literally repulsive in taste and appearance (like fish in a cold sperm soup). Service was also slow with an average time of 15-20 minutes between each course. We ate too much bread and butter due to the delays.

It's coasting on it's reputation.
