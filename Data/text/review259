I was at volunteer park and hangry so I checked Yelp for highest rated purveyors of food Herb & Bitter came up so we went.

We had the duck pate which was more of a mousse than anything. It came with a golden raspberry confiture, cornichons and grilled bread. All very very good.  For our main meal we had the wild boar meatballs in mole and I'd say it's one of the better moles in the area and a lot better than the stuff pushed at Meximerican restaurants. 

For beer we like porters and stouts but the only thing they had on draft was Anchor, possibly the worst porter on the planet in my opinion so we picked up a bottle of Old Rasputin instead which was very nice if a bit stiff.

Overall, great environment and good friendly service.
