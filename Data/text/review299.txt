Wonderful Polish food for a terrific price in Greenpoint Brooklyn-- definitely recommend the lunch specials which include a soup and a side in addition to the entree.  Had the white borscht soup and the stuffed cabbage, which came with a side of potato with sliced chunks of bacon. Everything was delicious.  Servers were polite.  Restaurant is exceptionally clean.  So good!
