Came here yesterday with some friends to enjoy some tapas and some cocktails. One of my friends confused this place with "Pardon my French" which is totally understandable, I asked their owner about it and there is some friendly relation between the two chefs.

Excuse my French is one of the most beautiful cocktail spots I've been to recently. The walls, the ceilings, the paintings, the lighting - everything screams romantic, vintage, artsy...it's a gorgeous place for a date. 

I had 2 cocktails here - champagne with rose reduction with an edible hibiscus flower (I felt like a princess) and an Ocean Mist because I'm obsessed with all things ocean-related and it's blue. Both were delicious. I also got to try a cocktail that was dedicated to a French woman who died in an elevator...fascinatingly sad story, beautiful cocktail. They also brought out a special layered cocktail made for Bastille Day, it was made to look like the French flag and served with a pop rock rim and a rock candy skewer to to stir with. Cocktails and candy? I'm sold. Sign me up!

We pretty much tried all the tapas and the ones that stood out to me the most were their own-seated tuna and their grilled salmon gravlax with dill citrus marinade on toast. For dessert they brought out a sugary crepe with light orange flavor that had been drizzled with grand mariner and they lit it on fire. Dessert set on fire and drizzled with alcohol? SIGN ME UP AGAIN!! The crepe was pretty good. I liked the texture but it was sugarier than I prefer.

Overall my friends and I had a really great time here and I would definitely return for some more awesome cocktails!
