Thursday Kitchen is okay. Just okay. Went with some girlfriends for a catch up dinner & drinks. 

A few comments:
- Ambience: it's cute, with low lighting, and is in the basement space of a building. It's a bit more cramped than other restaurants, even in NYC and the LES specifically. Our table was basically suited for one person, but had three seats - the unlucky third had to sit between our table and the one next to us making for an awkward seating arrangement for all involved. 
- Wait: we waited about 2 hours on a Friday. Not unexpected, so doesn't impact my rating here.
- Service: service was odd. no one seemed particularly interested in the food they were serving, or creating a good experience for diners. read below my comment on the "gnocchi" dish. 

What we had, and notes specific to each item:

- avocado - creme fraiche was <adj> overwhelming </adj>, and gave the dish an <adj> incredibly </adj> creamy consistency overall. the flavor was good, but the texture took away from the freshness of the raw avocado in my opinion.
- truffle mac and cheese - limited flavor of truffles here. it was our "favorite" item, but who doesn't love cheese and pasta? would have expected a very strong truffle flavor. 
- soft shell crab - well prepared, no complaints here other than this dish is a little difficult to share.
- gnocchi - definitely had the most Korean flavors of all of the dishes. however, our waiter did not tell us to mix the garlic aioli into the gojuchang sauce, so it made for a strange eating experience. a waiter told us at the very end that we hadn't eaten it correctly, but provided no remedy for "our" mistake. this probably frustrated me the most.
- pure jeremy (drink) - both drinks were <adj> delicious </adj>, and loved the concept in the bags. although not unique to Thursday Kitchen, it was definitely cute. 
- ms. cutetini (drink) - same comment as above.

Overall, I wouldn't go back here except to grab a quick drink from the bar. The food is nowhere close to the quality or flavor of other Korean restaurants, and the dishes just aren't interesting enough for me to justify how far it strays.
