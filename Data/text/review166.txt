Wow, I can't even describe how good this place is. We had a group of 9 and the service was just as stellar as the food.

We ordered a little bit of everything from fish, steak (Holy COW amazing), stuffed rice dumplings, and still left a bit of space for dessert. Starting with the appetizers, we had a sublime egg and stuffed dumpling. I've never had something so creamy and delicious.

Seriously one of the best experiences I've had. The waiter was super quick and answered all our questions about the food. She was patient and was very happy to explain all the dishes.

A best in Austin, would recommend for anyone.
