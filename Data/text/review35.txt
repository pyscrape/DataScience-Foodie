Thoughts:

The best Old Fashioned I've ever had.

The absolute best service I've ever had at a restaurant. I have eaten at a lot of nice restaurants, but Canlis put most all of them to shame. The service alone makes this review 5 stars.

The second best view from any Seattle restaurant (the best being atop the Space Needle).

After having the full course menu (which was spectacular) is to skip the full wine pairing (which we each also had, and didn't really enjoy). The wine pairings were almost too much for me, and were way too much for my wife. If you're stuck on getting the wine pairings (and you really like both red and white wines), I strongly suggest considering sharing the flight. I'm very glad we took an Uber to and from. The amount of alcohol we consumed tamped down a bit on our delight of the food.

Seattle has so many wonderful restaurants with some of the best food I've ever had anywhere, but Canlis distinguishes itself with service, class, and atmosphere. I've had food just as good elsewhere in town, but nowhere else puts it all together like this.

Canlis also distinguishes itself with the price. This was our 20th anniversary dinner, so we didn't hold back at all, and it ended up being, by far, and I mean BY FAR, the single most expensive dining experience the two of us have ever had. Canlis should have 6 of those $'s that Yelp uses. That said, I don't regret it at all.
