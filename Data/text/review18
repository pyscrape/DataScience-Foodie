Dee Dee Indeed!! 

With a hankering for Thai food, I searched Yelp for something in my neighborhood and decided to give Dee Dee a try! 

The trailer was fairly busy on a Thursday night around 8pm. We ordered the Pad Kra Pow (pork), the Om Gai (chicken), and Som Tom papaya salad. Since they were busy, we waited about 15-20 minutes, which I didn't think was that long. When our food was almost ready, the owner apologized for the wait and gave us some sparkling waters! A very nice gesture! 

We took our food to-go and dug in when we got home. Everything was super fresh and delicious with complex flavors. My favorite dish was the Pad Kra Pow, which packs a spicy punch balanced with fresh herbs and cucumber. The papaya salad was super spicy, delicious, and refreshing! My boyfriend's fav dish was the Om Gai, which was less spicy but still super aromatic and flavorful. Portions are large and we were stuffed with plenty left over for lunch the next day. 

This is definitely the best Thai food I've had in Austin, and I hope they stick around for years to come!
