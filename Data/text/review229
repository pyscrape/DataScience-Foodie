Disappointing Customer Service.
We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday.  The food was ok.  The server was nice.  But what really sours my experience was I found a dirty piece of hard metal in my left-overs!  Since I don't live close to the restaurant, I called them to let them know what happened.  I asked for the manger to call me back.  It's been a week and no follow-up from the restaurant.  I would've thought they would want to see the metal object so they can determine if this was an isolated incident or not.  I even wrote them a letter and included the metal piece--still no response.  Really very disappointing that this place doesn't care about the safety of it's diners!
