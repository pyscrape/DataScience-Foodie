First time we visited here on a Monday morning at 1130am, there was a line out the door. The second time we tried coming an hour before closing and there was almost no line with several open tables. So, pick your timing well if you don't feel like waiting in a line! At this restaurant you order your food first and then sit down, so it's frowned upon to save a seat before you order.

The menu here is always changing but the pastas are always delicious! 
We ordered 1 of each pasta because we just couldn't choose! There were 2 pappardelle pastas and a gigli pasta. There was the pappardelle de bolognese which is the more common pasta on their menu, and then the other pappardelle had anchovies but that was our least favorite. Our favorite turned out to be the vegetarian gigli pasta with a rich and creamy sauce that was to die for. We also ordered some focaccia which was soft and airy and made for a great appetizer or mop for your extra sauce.

Overall, the pasta here was some of the best we've ever had and the staff there are super friendly. If you end up coming at a busy time you may end up having to share a table with another party. For $9 a pasta, I'm most definitely going to make a trip back here the next time I am craving some pasta!
