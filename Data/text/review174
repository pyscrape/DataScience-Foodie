This place did not disappointing and was worth every penny! It has also been one of the best dinning experience of our lives. 
We had the chef's tasting. Every single thing was delicious. There were a few aspects of every dish that was new and experimental. Waiter was new to the restaurant, but well informed. I would recommend sitting at the chef's bar area if you get the chance so you can see how everything is made.
