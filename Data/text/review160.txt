Forget comparisons to Austin, there's simply is NO better restaurant. Don't make the mistake of choosing a dish, due the tasting menu. Not only will you have the best meal of your life with depths of flavor and imaginative I gruber combos you would never dream of, but the chef typically throws in some extra courses as well. 

This restaurant has been applauded nationally for a reason, you can't learn to cook like this in culinary school. This stuff is genius level. And to be able to enjoy a sampling of their various dishes to complete a meal will give you an experience you've simply never had. 

I attended culinary school, I've won several awards for my cooking, I've had recipes published, and I've travelled the world...but during my first meal here I said "Not only could I never dream of cooking like this in a million years, I've never experienced a meal like that."

It's my favorite restaurant in Austin. In anywhere. And it just occurred to me last night when discussing it with others that I'd never Yelped it. 

Shame on me. 

Also when someone raves like this I personally rarely trust the review so it should be noted I don't know anyone here at all. But boy do I admire their craft. 

It's like an artist stepping into the studio of one of the masters.
