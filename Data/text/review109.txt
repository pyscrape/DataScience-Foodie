Great spot, although a bit pricey since all of the small plates are really expensive given the small quantity of food.

We had the thai deviled eggs, eggplant chips, brisket sliders, pork tacos, and a whole bunch of cocktails.

I really enjoyed the smoked cocktail.

Service was pretty efficient, and the place ended up getting pretty packed. I think you'd be okay if you wanted to eat here before a show.
