Two words: Dole whip. Make that three words: Dole whip float.

I last ate Dole whip when I was in Oahu 5 years ago, and eating it again at goPoke brought back all the great memories from my time there with Mr. W.  GoPoke's Dole whip float is a beautiful concoction of Dole whip, pineapple juice, and pineapple pieces...the best part is that it's adorned with delicious li hing powder. I LOVE LI HING; I LOVE IT. If you've never had li hing before, it is salty, sweet, and sour. It gives me life and brings the fuzzies, because I would always eat li hing mui with my grandma when I was a kid. 

Onto the poke -- this fish is fresh! I ordered a salmon poke bowl with white rice, ocean salad, furikake, and pickled ginger. There are a lot of topping options and sides on the menu, but I like to keep it simple. The salmon was well-marinated. I tasted soy, sesame, some chilis, sweet onions, but I could still taste the salmon itself. It was a bit on the salty side for me, but the rice helps to neutralize that. The portion of the protein was smaller than I'm used to at my usual poke spot, but I like the flavors of the salmon marinade here. 

The people who work here are so endearing and warm. They made my friends and I felt looked after and welcomed. They enbodied that "aloha spirit."

Btw, they have spam musubi and Bubbies!! I should have ordered those, but I thought I was going to be too full from poke and Dole whip. Ugh..regrets.
