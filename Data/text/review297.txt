What an authentic Polish restaurant!  Starting with the decor, the brown wooden benches, wishing well in the dining room, wooden cabin where the restrooms are; overall it had a very authentic feel!  There was about a 1 hour wait on a Friday night but they were very accommodating in taking our number and calling us so we didn't have to stay in the restaurant and wait. 

My husband and I had the white borscht soup that came with a side of mash and bacon bits on top that was so delicious!  For dinner we had the Roasted Hocks and Polish Plater along with a Polish Village Salad. Every single item in the dishes were absolutely delightful!  We probably didn't need the salad since everything else was so filling but glad we got it to taste! 

We will definitely be back many more times so we can try all the dishes !
