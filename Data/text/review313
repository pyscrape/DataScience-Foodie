Nestled in the basement Excuse My French brings a bit of class to Orchard Street.

A long sweeping bar is the main feature with dark wood and that classic 40s vibe oozing out of the walls, check out the tiny kitchen at the end of the bar as well, talk about an open kitchen!

Cocktails and French style small plates are the order of the day here. Cocktails are brave, full of old world style (ie short and boozy) and not shy to get theabsinthe out when needs be, there's a lot to like on the menu.

I'm a sucker for small plates as I tend to want to try pretty much everything on the menu so I'm always happy to see a bunch of contemporary French food that I can create a nice spread from. Food was all tasty, ranged from pretty to very good and it's all the right size to go, have a snack (or 6) with your boozy cocktail and feel like a hero.
