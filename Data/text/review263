DELICIOUS

Oh man are we glad Kichin opened up walking distance from our apartment. My favorites are the Bibimbap and the Grilled Chicken bowl, both of which you can get on rice or a salad if you're feeling healthy. Both are piled with tender meat and fresh vegetables and make a super filling, but nutritious dinner. My boyfriend and I have been here half a dozen times now between the two of us, and have always loved our food. His favorites are the rice balls, especially the avocado edamame. 

The food is a little expensive for a takeaway place in this neighborhood, but the food is so fresh and flavorful, I think it's completely worth it. The iced teas are also tasty. The guys running the place are friendly and seem to really care about the food. Seating is a little limited, but the food travels well and it's easy to pick up and take elsewhere.
