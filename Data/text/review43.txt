The rice is just plain sushi rice. If it were seasoned it would be so much better!
The amount of fish you get is decent, but there are other places that give you more.
Some of the veggie selections don't feel authentic, but overall is good.
And the aoli sauce is amazing.
Oohhhh, and if you want dessert, they make their own mochi ice cream. I liked their espresso chocolate and passion fruit the best.
They also have shaved ice--and you can have it with the red Mexican candy powder. Yummy!!!!!
