(Review from September) I have been here twice in the last 3 weeks and again last night. I will be bringing friends here for more visits for sure.  Thursday Kitchen consistently blew me out of the water with the food and service.  I think I've waited for 20-30 minutes for a table for 3-4 people at around 8:30pm. I've also been here right when dinner service starts and no wait of course. At this point think at this point I've had everything on the menu and really can't go wrong.  The mac and cheese and the fried chicken is a crowd pleaser.  

The drinks are cash-only bar so bring cash. Their light-up capri-sun-like drink containers are innovative and fun...oh yeah and the drinks are great too.   I recommend the Jeremy drink!!

On one visit something was wrong with my dish and after bringing it to the attention of the staff, they were extremely responsive and attentive. I think 4 staff apologized to me directly and they gave me a replacement dish on the house.  I really appreciated their attention to my satisfactions and have been referring everyone to patron this place since. I'll be back soon I'm sure :)
