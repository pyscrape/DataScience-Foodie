Came here on snowy winter night and has a great meal.  Service was efficient and courteous. We shared the Cajun chicken which was one of best chicken dishes I've ever had
  Duck was good and the sliders were perfect little hamburgers.   Finished with crepe suzzett flambe to top off the night.  Would recommend this highly.
