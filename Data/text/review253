Had drinks and dinner on a Friday night. The place was crowded, and we had great service. Servers and manager helped us try drinks that that were and that were not on the menu. The outdoor seating area is spacious and great, and with the retractable roof looks like a great place to hangout in the summer. We ordered a wide variety off the menu and none of us were disappointed. Basically these folks can do no wrong with potatoes. Totally delicious! Great spot, I will definitely be back!
