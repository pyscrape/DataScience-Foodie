Tonight was our second time to eat at Barley Swine...another triumph!!  From the crazy sounding cocktails to food with flavors we couldn't possibly fathom to the personalized and perfect service from Oscar and the other staff...this is THE PLACE to dine!  Everyone made us feel so special making tonight the perfect anniversary dinner!  There's not a doubt in my mind that we'll be back!
