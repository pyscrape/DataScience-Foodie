List was a pleasant detour from our initial goal for Shiro's. It's quiet and peaceful. I often associate tapas restaurants with a level of pretentiousness. However, the service and presentation at List felt authentic, and they just genuinely love great food and great drinks. 

I ordered the sauvig blanc, which complimented my meal. The complimentary bread was good, except they don't give enough olive oil. They will give you more if you ask. The sea salt and pepper calamari was the best calamari I've ever had. The breading and the softness of the squid was excellent. It felt like I was eating puffy clouds of squid.

The bacon wrapped wild gulf prawns was good. The beans underneath were strangely spicy in comparison. I wouldn't recommend the grilled chilean sea bass. I don't know what sustainably caught means, but the sea bass was average and it was almost on the chewy side. I've had better elsewhere and the sauces underneath it don't seem to help.
