H-O-L-Y happy hour. A bottle of wine and appetizers for two - this is the place to go. The environment is more on the romantic side, but is also a more modern chic environment as well.

I absolutely love their grilled Caesar Salad - the heads of lettuce are literally grilled and have the dressing and parmesan thrown on top. The gnocchi is also a great choice. The eggplant parmigiana is next on my list :)
