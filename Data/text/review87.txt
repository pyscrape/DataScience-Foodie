The poke at Simple is some of the best I've had! We tried both the spicy tuna and ahi tuna bowls. Both were delicious but the ahi tuna stood out - served over a healthy portion of brown rice and numerous toppings (such as pickles veggies, ginger, avocado, wonton crisps, etc), the ahi tuna steak was thinly sliced and perfectly seared on the outside/raw on the inside. Also, the taro bubble tea was out of this world.

The service was super friendly and even though the restaurant is small, it's comfortable and we were able to easily grab two seats for dinner. Highly recommend!
