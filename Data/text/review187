This is by far the most busiest tourist attraction Italian restaurant I have seen so far! I literally waited almost an hour and half to try there infamous pasta!!! It was worth it at the end of the visit. 

If I were to go again I would definitely pick a day that I will be willing to wake up early and wait in line before the place open. There restaurant hour is pretty short but I don't see it surprising at all. It's from 11am to 3pm! 

After waited for an hour when me and my friend were in the restaurant lol you still have to wait until you get to the front to order your food! They have daily specialties or something. I ordered one of them "forgot the name" but it was delicious. There home made bread was great too very soft and buttery in every bite. They should be thinking of expanding their business! The restaurant isn't that big. Anyway!

The price is very affordable for some freshly made Italian pasta ! If you are a big eater I would recommended order two order pasta and a side of there handmade bread. :) Oh and friendly cashier who took my order because I really have no clue how to say there item on there menu! Haha!
