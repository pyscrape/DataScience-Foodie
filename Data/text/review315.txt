We stumbled upon EMF while walking around the LES last weekend, and made it a point to come here immediately.

The LES is filled with cozy little wine and cocktail bars, but this definitely one of the better ones.  The decor is amazing, the food is fantastic, and the portions are generous!

They have a happy hour until 8p, and we happened to arrive a bit before that and ordered a few glasses of the Beaujolais which was fantastic! Of course, this was accompanied by cheese and charcuterie, including Camembert, Ossau Iraty and Parisian Ham. The portions were HUGE, but being a cheese and bread monger we took this down with ease.

Great ambience and lovely hospitable service, will certainly be back soon!
