Everyone is always so friendly here and willing to do things your way. One thing I really like about the 45th Stop N Shop is you automatically get rice and lettuce in your bowl unless you ask differently can't remember if brown rice is an option there, but it is here! I ask if I could get part brown rice and part lettuce in my bowl with the rice on the bottom so the poke wouldn't be sitting on hot rice they were happy to oblige. I don't like a lot of the extras I don't feel that just because it's included it's needed I had the classic ahi with ginger, seaweed salad and cucumber. Had been craving poke all week this so hit the spot. Also grabbed a couple of desserts as a thank you to some girls at work. Love the dole whip floats! Best part is it's dairy free and who can  say no to li hing?
