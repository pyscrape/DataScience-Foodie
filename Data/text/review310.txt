I loved this restaurant! We sat at the bar and enjoyed several small plates. The escargot was delicious and the garlic filled the air. Tuna was amazing as well as the steak tartare. I loved how it was lightly seared on both sides. Brussel sprouts with lamb were fabulous and we loved the Cabernet we had during our meal for happy hour!
We had the opportunity to chat with the owner and co owner/chef. Both were very friendly and eager to please. I will definitely be back again and again. Wonderful!
