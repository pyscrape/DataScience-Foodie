Yumm...

This place is my girlfriend and I's use to be raving Happy Hour spot, haven't gone in a while due to the distance from our home. The service there is hit or miss depending on who you get. One of our waitress was always attentive and always poured us wine everytime she passed by. The other waitress, on the other hand was a bit stand off ish and wasn't personable.

The food - we like the seabass, gnocchi was very rich and creamy - but like pillows in your mouth. We also enjoyed their grilled ceasar salad - a bit weird at first bite because it is cooked lettuce, but the grill taste does not disappoint. All in all, we enjoy our visit to List.
