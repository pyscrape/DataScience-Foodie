This place is absolutely delicious! The menu changes on the daily based on the availability of local ingredients and also in what foragers (who they have on staff) are able to bring in that day. 99% of all ingredients they use are locally sourced, organic and non-GMO. Pretty much all the entree plates are made to share, all are relatively small so that you have room to try other absolutely delicious items on the menu. Oh AND a cart comes out a few times while you are dining with small bites of other amazing foods that you can (or don't have to). They call them "dim sum" but that got nothing to do with Chinese cuisine, it's more for the style of delivery. Some of the best dishes that all four of us loved were the sunchokes, romaine salad (not your average salad! Comes with nice crispy elements), short ribs, aged pork and pasta! Also crudo and makarel were also pretty amazing. Beef tartar was one of our favorites from the cart and for dessert, burnt milk was so unique and tasty! Honestly, everything was on point and perfectly seasoned. We all agreed that blue crab tapa from the cart was just alright, not bad but fades in comparison to everything else. We are definitely coming back again soon.
