Big fan of Il Corvo. Great portion sized pastas (not too much, not too little) for $9. The venue is super small which explains the long lines out the door. Expect to wait at least 30 mins (on a good day). Not to worry though, they have a great system of getting food out within minutes of ordering (A+).

On my most recent visit, me and my friends ordered all three options of pasta which included a Pappardelle w Bolognese sauce, "Di Verdure" Lasagne, and a Pesto dish. Keep in mind that they're always rotating the pastas out. We also ordered the Focaccia, which is really a must when visiting Il Corvo. I have yet to try their kale salad though, but it looks like a great option. Their Pappardelle is pretty regularly on the menu and definitely a great choice, but I really enjoyed their vegetarian Lasagne. I loved the pieces of squash and just the flavor in general. There's a reason why Il Corvo is so popular, definitely check it out for yourself! (:
