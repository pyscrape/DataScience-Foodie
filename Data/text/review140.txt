Overall, solid American fair that's well executed, and the portions are sufficient to share among a party of 4. We appreciated the thoughtful staff who even cut our hamburger into 4 pieces when we divulged that we'd be sharing all of the entrees. 

ROASTED CHICKEN SALAD - the baked chicken thigh was moist and seasoned with salt & pepper. The warm chicken was delicious with the fresh arugula greens that are lightly dressed in a cranberry vinaigrette. Good proportion of candied pecans and beets along with two wedges of camembert cheese elevated the flavors and textures for a rather simple salad.

CONGRESS BURGER - moist beef with fresh lettuce and tomatoes to add some lightness to the dish. Try to sub out the chips for fries.. the house made chips were fine but fries are always better!

POMODORO PIZZA + ITALIAN SAUSAGE - the crust here is unique and splendid - there's a bit of grittiness that comes through from the corn meal which has been incorporated into the dough. This adds even more pizzazz to the very thin and crisp crust. If you don't like the cracker-like crusts, then you won't be a fan of their style of pizza. I appreciated the heap of basil added to the top rather than the 3-4 whole small leaves that you might get for a traditional Neapolitan pizza. The sausage was good - not too salty and had a bit of fennel flavoring.

As a "dessert", we shared the FRENCH TOAST - which is like no other french toast - the thick texas toast drenched in pecans, bananas and syrup made for a decadent finish to a very good meal. This dish almost tasted as if true banana bread was used to make the french toast but the bread was still light and not overly eggy.
