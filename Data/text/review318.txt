Bf and I came in on a rainy Tuesday.  The bartender and space were very warm and friendly.  Cocktails were mixed extremely well.  The La Recolte in particular as someone else mentioned was very bright and not too sweet. Staff were well-versed in menu and liquor.  Escargot, rilletes, pate were all standards that were well done.  The cheese selection was nice.  The owner was also accessible and lovely.  Typically, I only take food/drink into account in reviews but we had such a pleasant evening that I wanted to mention the entire experience.
