Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

More like 4.5 stars for reasons to be explained later.  I struggle with reviewing restaurants like Canlis since I do side-by-side comparisons.  Of course I compare to other fine dining that I've had nationwide, but do I compare it to Michelin starred places even though Michelin doesn't go to Seattle?  As it's generally considered the nicest fine dining establishment in Seattle, do I compare it just to other top restaurants in other cities that aren't Michelin starred?  

What ti boils down to, the meal was excellent but not one of the best of our lives, which is why I can't give it 5 stars.  The menu consisted of:

Escarole, olives, anchovies - a fine starter but nothing mind-blowing
Scallops - very good, one of the best dishes of the night
Fluke - served sashimi-style with strawberries.  Interesting, not compelling.  Weakest dish.
Black cod - another excellent dish, helps that black cod is so fatty
Pork - A middling dish in the group
Strawberry with fromage blanc - an average fine dining dessert
Apricots and chocolate - ditto here

The wine pairing was also nice, paired fairly well, but nothing surprising with a pairing and no very interesting wines.

So the meal was very good, deserving of 4 stars.  I guess the 1/2 star bump would go to ambiance and venue - gorgeous - and the fact that if you ask for a tour of the property, they will oblige with a short tour around the house.  This was a nice touch.

My other struggle is this - we also went to Art of the Table in the same trip and for less money (and of course, worse ambiance) we has food that tasted just as excellent, if not more so.  Food for thought.
