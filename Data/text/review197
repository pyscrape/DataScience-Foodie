We got there less than 15 minutes after they opened on a Friday, and yes there was a humungo line, and even though we waited for almost an hour, the whole time I was like omgomg*stare-at-other-peoples-food*omgomgomg and then we finally made it to the front and we were like omgomgomg one of each omgomg and a bread too, and omgomgomg yay seat opened and omgomgomg glad to see the cashier was totally used to this kinda googly-eyed foodie behavior. 

Seriously why would you wait an hour and not get all three? 9$. Even if it was just myself eating. It baffles me how people have any sort of self-control when it comes to something so beautiful as il corvo pasta. 

I'm not going to pretend I know any Italian - there was brown tubey meat pasta, purple beet sunset pasta, and green pesto snake pasta THAT WAS SO COOL. And soooo good. Like there was maybe 3 pastas in there... look at the texture of this thing. 

Everything was amazing. Except the bread which was spongey but ok. Wished I saved more room for pasta. God I miss the place. Why can't more Italian places be like this!?
