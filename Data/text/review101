Right below Eighth Avenue in the theater district sits this gem. This isn't a sports bar, but more like one from the Prohibition days. Many kicked up cocktails with funky names.

The food is good and presented nicely.  We had the poutine. It is basically fries with mozzarella and brown gravy. Not exactly poutine that you would get in Montreal, but tasty nonetheless. 

Went here especially for the burgers. They were tasty and juicy. I would consider again if in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way.

Our server was on point our entire meal.
