This is probably the best cocktail lounge in the immediate vicinity of the theater district.  They'll seat you quickly, serve up some amazing small plates and will stir up an awesome cocktail.  Red is the new black and the "kiss kiss bang bang" are must gets! 

The service was excellent and we were in and out in about an hour.  If you're in a rush, I'm sure they could be flexible.
