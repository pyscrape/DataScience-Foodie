We came in on a Friday night and was quoted a 2 hour wait but it turned into a 2 hour 45 min wait. They can't be blamed for this since it is hard to predict how fast tables will turn. However, what they did have control over was the fact that they allowed their friends to walk in and instantly get a table without waiting, despite the long wait time. Also, we witnessed someone else slipping the owner money after hearing how long the wait would be. Definitely not fair for the rest of us! 

What would have become a total disaster quickly escalated into a wonderful meal once we were finally seated. The staff were super friendly and knowledgable about their menu and the food was absolutely amazing. I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first, but the dishes exceeded my expectations.

My favorites:
Kimchi Paella: Creamy and full of flavor although it is too liquidy to be considered a paella.  
Steak: Cooked to perfection. The steak was very juicy and the sauted kale was seasoned perfectly.
Truffle mac and cheese- Cheesy mozzarella, truffles, & clams. What's not to love?
Popcorn ice cream- tasted like the Cracker Jack popcorn in ice cream form. 

Items I would skip next time:
Octopus- good but the portion of the octopus is too small. I did enjoy the sauce drenched on top though.
Eel taco: Flavors were just okay. I didn't think that the Eel went well as a taco. The taste of the torch used was empowering. 

I think I would come back to try some of the other items on the menu and to revisit some of the ones I really enjoyed! Hopefully the wait won't be as long next time around.
