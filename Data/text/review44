Typical low-end buffet quality sushi.  The reason students rate this so highly is because they can't cook anything other than ramen noodles and rice at home.  lol.  I've gotten better quality quality poke at a local Kroger (QFC or Fry's).  

While the service was good and the workers passionate, the freshness of sushi suffers.  Management really needs to look into not serving sushi that has gone bad.  Some of the sushi tasted like it went bad.  I only ate one or two bad pieces and threw the rest away.  Even then, I felt a nauseated feeling hours later.

Overall at best this is low-end sushi buffet quality, at worst, you can get sick eating this.
