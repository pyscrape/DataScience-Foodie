I love Korean food but I thought this place was pretty average. Granted, I only tried the bibimbap, so maybe the other dishes are better. There is also extremely limited seating, which isn't necessarily a drawback but it's something to keep in mind if you were planning to go with other people. Overall, I can see how this could be a good place to grab a bite if you're in a rush, but I didn't feel like the dish I had was worth the $13 I paid for it.
