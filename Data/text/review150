This was about an average experience. They had lots of beer, wine, and liquor options which was a plus. Cool location and nice decor.
I found the bartenders and staff pretty rude - I was worried we had come in right before closing because they made us feel so unwelcome, but they weren't closing for over an hour. We had the avocado and chorizo dip that was pretty yummy and I liked the drinks. 
They were showing blade runner and some other weird movie, which I thought was cool. 
Overall it was fine, but it was expensive, the service wasn't great, and there are lots of other options available nearby
