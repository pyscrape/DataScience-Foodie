I have been here before but my east coast buddy had one night in Seattle and had never been. I kind of figured it was gonna be lackluster having been before but...

Impeccable service and food. If you ask for a tour they'll take you after dessert (make sure to tip :-))

Recommend the 9pm seating. You'll get the window you requested and feel like the only ones there. 

Renewed respect. You're no longer that place I'm supposed to like.
