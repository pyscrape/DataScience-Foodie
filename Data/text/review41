First time here and tried the 12th man bowl. People working there are really friendly. Overall it was good although one or several of the poke was too spicy for me. I've actually never encountered that sort of spice before with poke even when we order the spicy option. So just letting you know. Husband felt the same with his Aloha bowl.

Sampled the dole whip and it was really good and calmed down that spice episode I was experiencing. 

Will probably be back if I'm ever in that area and order the non spicy option.
