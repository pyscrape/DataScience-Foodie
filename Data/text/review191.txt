My sister and I came in around 1:30pm on a Monday and the wait wasn't too long. It took us around 25 min to wait in line, order and get our food. 

Atmosphere;
*It's a pretty small place with seating for around.. 20-30 people? But I think it makes it that much homier and cozy
*Seating is communal style. The only negative thing about that might be the noise level
* The servers bring the pasta and dishes to you but you have to get your own water and utensils. You also have to bus your own tables after!

Food;
*We ended up ordering all three of the pasta specials that they had as well as their homemade focaccia. It was a lot to share between the two of us  but it was worth trying everything. 
* The focaccia was crispy on the top because of the melted cheese but the bread is very soft and dense. It was the perfect starter and it's worth trying!
* The pastas are cooked al dente which is the best way to be eaten and each dish wasn't drowning in sauce like some other places might have it. Some might consider it to be a little too salty but it wasn't bad. 
* The shapes and textures of the pastas also complimented the sauces really well. Overall really yummy pastas 

Cost;
* For 9$ a dish, its one of the best prices for such a good meal! The portions are perfect for lunch

Overall;
I think it's worth waiting the line for! Definitely try it out when you have enough time for lunch!
