I was in town for ACL and had brunch here on a Sunday ... my fatass ordered a Bloody Mary to start, the Avocado Fundido ($12) and the Congress burger with truffle fries ($14 + $4 for the truffle fries).  The truffle fries were pretty good, crispy on the outside and had a nice truffle flavor.  The Avocado Fundido was something different!  House chorizo in a mini skillet with avocado and queso asadero melted on top, along with chipotle corn chips.  Usually I like everything pretty seasoned, but I thought the chips had a bit too much seasoning on them (it became pretty salty on some chips).  But overall, this was a solid spot to eat and I had leftovers which eventually went to waste in the hot heat :(.  If this was in New York I would come back again :)
