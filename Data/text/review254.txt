I'm a sucker for fancy bars and outdoor seating.  We came in 10 minutes before the kitchen closed and they still took our orders!  I was very impressed as I was sure they were going to turn us away.  What I appreciated and enjoyed the most was the quality of their dishes,  Even though my drink wasn't some alcoholic cocktail concoction, they still gave me a very unique experience.  I had a soda and shrub blackberry drink, which used vinegar to preserve the berry,, something to that nature that was something I never had before, and IT WAS SO COOL.  With my non-alcoholic drink I was still feeling pretty fresh and fancy, as the drink was just so unique and presented beautifuly.

Now onto the actual food.  We ordered the boar meatballs, grilled beef skewers, and the pan seared salmon.  The boar meatball was skippable, the sauce kind of tastes like hoisin sauce and the bread served with it was a bit strange.  The other dishes were great, however in a surprising manner.  I actually enjoyed the salad mixes more than the meat options itself!  The salads were just so perfectly mixed, that gave me an assortment of flavors i had to keep going back for.  It was a strange experience as the meat is usually the spotlight but man, that black eye pea salad I could go back for.  

I had a really great time here, but not too much else on the menu i want to check out.  great place if youre looking for somewhere more intimate and relaxing on broadway.
