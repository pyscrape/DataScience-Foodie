Came with a group of friends for a birthday celebration, this restaurant is a tapa restaurant meaning the portions for every tapa are very small and is convenient for sharing. We ordered two orders of shrimp with gambas, their mussels and their steak skewers. I thought that everything was okay. My favorite were the mussels, very flavorful.
