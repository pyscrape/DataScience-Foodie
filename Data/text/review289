I have Polish friends. I've been to Greenpoint several times over the years. But why I have never had Polish food (a homemade salad, if you count that), I don't know. But I'm totally hooked and will never refuse if offered any food in a Polish household again.

Polish food is amazing. The inside resembles a Medieval household where you can come home to enjoy a homemade comfort meal after a long day of labor work--even the waiters are dressed in traditional Polish folk costumes that'll take you away from the modern world. 

What can I say...almost everything here is delicious, guaranteed. Even if it's "bad," it's not worse than any bad meal I've ever had.  Since it is a family-style restaurant, the portions are huge. You can easily be semi-bloated from the Potato Pancakes--the mushroom sauce that comes with them is running-for-the-hills AMAZING. After killing two of these, you may want to reconsider your need for an entree.

If you plan on getting the White Borscht, try not to get an entree, unless you can really work up an appetite. This is pretty much a meal itself since it is creamy and heavy and served with mashed potatoes. I had ordered the Chicken Kebab plate (which comes in two massive skewers with fries and a whole plate of salad), totally underestimating the huge portions of the food, and wanted nothing of it after the Borscht and some appetizers. I didn't think the Borscht was anything special but soup in a bread bowl isn't common in New York, so that might easily attract people. I've also tried their Hunter's Stew, which might be heavy for some people; it is cooked with red wine and has a strong tomato taste to it. 

If you've never had Polish food, this is the probably the best place to start. It's very homely and the staff members are such warm, friendly people.
