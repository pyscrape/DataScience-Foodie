If you came by here 50 years ago, the grandfather I never met might've asked your bra size and sold you women's underwear. He had a store called Jay Ess Trading Company. It was a tiny LES wholesale shop filled with tobacco smoke, rats, and a chill in the air that killed two pet parakeets.

We had an amazing time there tonight.

Now it's Excuse My French, a fully redone bar and bistro rebuilt from the ground up by our new friend Ricardo and his husband. The exposed brick would've been plastered over back then, but now it covers the whole wall. It's warm and cozy and smoke-free and loaded with paintings and a sweet tin ceiling. The French chef will bark in his accent that he makes the best Brussels sprouts and crepes you've ever had, and Harry the server will bring you strong tasty cocktails you've never had before. Ricardo took excellent care of us as our family reunited with this location after 50 years and had a great time.

Roots traced. Drinks drank. Memories made. So great. Thank you Ricardo!!
