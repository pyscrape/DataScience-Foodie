I had my first poke bowl here, and I instantly understood the craze. I got the salmon bowl with salad base (no extra charge!), which was amazing! The sauce was perfectly balanced, the salmon tasted fresh, as did the veges; one bite led me to the next and I finished the bowl beyond satisfied! My cousin got the squid bowl and was equally pleased. However, don't think we would've been able to finish the bowl if the meal prior wasn't 8 hours ago and we didn't spent all day walking around SoHo!

I followed the advice from previous reviews and tried their milk tea, and was surprised to find that their boba milk tea was pretty amazing! It definitely hopped into my top 3 favorite shops for boba. Tried a sip of my cousin's passion fruit tea, which was super refreshing.

Their amazing service struck me the most. It's probably the best of the Asian restaurants I've been to. The people seemed super down-to-earth and just happily doing what they love to do. 

The interior is pretty small, as in, two small tables and one long table that sat around ~8 (?). There was a constant stream of customers while we waited and ate (~8pm). May be plan for take-outs? The decor is cute and hip though and would probably make a good Instagram photo if you catch a seat! Definitely come and check it out!
