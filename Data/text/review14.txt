Yes I like this place. I'm been here twice in a would like to come back every other day. I like Thai food; I love authentic Thai food. I had the minced pork with rice, and then another one dish where the rice is wrapped up in a surround wrap, also dip with minced support. Everytime I come there and out of pork skewers. I wish they made more.

Is it me or did the mango sticky rice price go down? I'm not complaining.
