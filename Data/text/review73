The first time we attempt to come here was Friday and we learn our lesson to never step in because the wait was very long. If you want to try this place out come during a Sunday night when they open. The perks, you will get a free beer and no wait ! 

Korean tapas & alcohol inside a Capri sun that lights up; interesting concept. 

Each dish you order the waiter(tress) will give you a summary behind it. 

Mac and cheese truffle: three kinds of cheese plus clams 

Crispy chicken: sweet spicy crunchy all in one mix! 

Pork belly tacos: I prefer a whole tortilla to myself. 

Kimichi paellea: Spanish and Korean fusion, I don't really like kimchi but this dish goes well together. Rice was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. 

Water was refill from time to time.
