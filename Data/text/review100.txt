Fantastic apres-work cocktail and nibbles place.
I normally can't stand mid-town Manhattan, especially around Times Square and the theatre district. Just too much craziness going on and I hate having to walk through it. After reading the reviews here, I wanted to check it out and seriously, if you like cleverly-named and yummy cocktails, this is a great spot. 
I had the sliders (OK) and the garlic fries (to die for and the best I've had outside of California) with the Ginger Rogers cocktail. Generous and yummy, the crowd here is also pretty cool and laid-back and the waitress I had was also really nice.
I hope tourists don't find this place because it's great as it is.
