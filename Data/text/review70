FYI: Bar upfront is CASH ONLY

Finally came and glad it finally happened. Saturday was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 so be prepared if you want to come on a weekend. Drinks are pretty much adult Capri Sun's in a bag with alcohol and a light cube. IG worthy! $9 a bag but worth it. Food is tapas style so thy recommend 2 orders per person which was right. First was the fried soft shell crab. It was very crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked in the middle. Great texture and wasabi sauce added a slightly spicy kick. Seafood pancake was not lacking on the seafood nor the flavor. Kimchi paella was really good. Seemed more like risotto cuz it was very saucy but I'm not mad at that. Seafood was fresh and not over-cooked. Fried chicken was slightly sweet and savory. Wish the outside was crispier and the inside was more moist though. Finished off with the matcha bread pudding. Not much matcha flavor as it seemed to be just topped with matcha powdered sugar but it was very moist and not overly sweet. I love this place!
