Had an excellent dinner here Saturday night. Ordered nearly all the dim sum, which don't come around constantly as they would in a traditional Chinese dim sum restaurant; they come three times during your dinner and you get to choose from 2 or 3 options. Nearly everything we had was delicious, especially the farmers cheese, charred broccoli, and the durum wheat spaghetti (best pasta dish I've had in years). Look forward to going back.
