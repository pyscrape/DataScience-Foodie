I hate to leave anything but a perfect review.  The food is exceptional here.  Each dish is clearly  cleverly crafted and executed and the service is great.  However when I brought a group for New Year's eve several friends asked me, "will there be enough to eat."  Legitimate question since it's definitely more gourmet servings.  I had previously eaten at the old location and there were 17 courses so while small, you left fully satisfied and thrilled with the quality.  For New Year's, the set price was much higher and there was half the courses from when I had been before.  

So the meal consisted of everyone giving me the hairy eyeball and feeling like I wanted to shrink under the table.  Followed up by everyone being really annoyed when the bill came and it was a fortune.  These are friends who don't mind paying a fortune for dinner but they just didn't feel they got the value.  I admit, I didn't either.  I was pretty bummed when we got in the car and they asked me to take them to In&Out Burger.  Sigh.  Not a great night.
