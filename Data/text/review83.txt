Quality than quantity, but not a bad deal.

I've been so spoiled from another poke spot on Canal St. They're expensive and portion is small. But the quality satisfies my craving for good food. Simple is very generous and honest food. My spicy tuna (with white rice and sesame seeds) for $10 is a bargain --  look at my photo. Not only It is a beautiful and packed full of goodies in a bowl, it's enough for two meals.
