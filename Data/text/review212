Incredible from beginning to end. We came here expecting "good" and received "outstanding". I have to add Emmer & Rye to the premier list, along with Uchi and Laundrette.

There were 2 of us and we lucked out with seats at the Chef's counter (there are only 4 spaces). Was great to watch and interact with the kitchen - a well oiled machine on a busy Saturday night. 

Highlights were the fresh cheese with smoked shishito relish, the blue crab with potato, arugula and roe, and the roasted shishito peppers with bread crumbs and gruyere. Among the best things I have tried in Austin this year. I also quite enjoyed the simplicity of the rigatoni with fresh tomatoes. The pasta was perfectly prepared and seasoning was spot on.

There was a butternut squash dish on the dim sum cart that was much more delicious than one would expect. Unfortunately we skipped dessert, as we had already had a sweet cocktail and a few glasses of wine. Next time I will prepare better. 

Service was very friendly and kept hustling. That said, I never felt rushed or ignored. Truly it was a standout experience.
