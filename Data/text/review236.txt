I could say 3.5 star.

We sat at a bar on a late Friday night. The bartender was friendly and she was on top of everyone's order even though it was a full bar. As far as the food, in my opinion the prices are way too high for the quality of food that they are serving. We ordered Caprese for the appetizer and were very disappointed with it. the description says Fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, but there was no basil and not a good Mozzarella for "fresh mozzarella" 

We also ordered Penne Bolognese and again nothing special. I would really suggest for them to make some changes in their menu since this place has a lot of potential and can be a great Italian restaurant. Great location as well!
