Love everything about this place! Their poke is fresh and portions are HUGE. Plus they don't charge you extra for seaweed!! The decor is super cute and modern, and they even have mouthwash for you in the bathroom! They sell Bubbies from Hawaii (bomb ice cream mochi) and that honestly saved me because my tongue was on fire from how spicy my bowl was haha!

Overall, great place filled with awesome food and excellent customer service!
