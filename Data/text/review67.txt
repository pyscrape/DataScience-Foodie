Come here right when it opens which is around 6pm because it gets packed af super fast. There's not that many seats. 

Service is super attentive- if you check into yelp you get a free beer!

Got the truffle mac and cheese, ugly potato, some meat dish, and paella. The sizes are basically tapas style. I think what they are known for is the capri bag alcohol- there's a cube that lights up inside- novelty. The food is pretty rich and flavorful (which I love). Ordered 4 tapas plus 2 capri bags and the bill was about 90...so it is kind of on the pricey side.

Giving it 4 stars because I like the novelty of the capri sun bags- quality of food wasn't bad but I don't think I would come back. It was a cool one time thing.
