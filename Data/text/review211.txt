Five stars voted unanimously by our group. Food, atmosphere, drinks, service and value - all outstanding. Dim sum cart is a fun extra, keep that in mind when ordering!

Favorites:
+ Velveteen rabbit cocktail - vodka, carrot juice and ginger. like a healthy tasting Moscow mule
+ Toasts: one with roasted vegetables, one with Texas caviar. both of them blew us away, maybe favorite bites of the night.
+ Cacio E Pepe - creamy perfection 
+ Johnny cake - dim sum, just get it. 
+Chicken larb - Vietnamese style chicken with rice
+ Chicken thigh - description is ordinary, dish is anything but. Comes with buttery Roti. 

Honestly, everything was amazing and I'll be back to try the rest of the menu as soon as I can!
