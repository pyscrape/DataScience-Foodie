May I say wow?! One of the many reasons I love visiting Austin, food truck culture! There is a food truck for almost every type of food you can think of and it never disappoints. Let me start by saying that my mouth is still burning from the Om Gai but it's a good thing. Om Gai is a soup with lots of cilantro, chicken, dill and zucchini and IT IS SPICY! But of course delicious! The broth is light but packed with flavor, the sticky rice acts like a bread and it absorbs all the deliciousness in the broth. I also tried the Thai tea and it was perfect, not too sweet, flavorful and creamy enough. Loved this place, definitely give it a try and don't be afraid of the spice, they can accommodate the level of spice depending on te dish.
