Oh Lord, there are seven hundred reasons why trailers are annoying, but one reason to go - because the food's great. It's the shortest distance between a chef's "This is what I do," and your "Give me your best shot." I'll take Dee Dee any day.

I know nothing about authentic Thai, and this niche of "Northern Thai street food" appears to involve lots of minced pork with home-grown basil. And lots of sticky rice. Wonderful stuff. Chef Lakana is also experimenting with fish sauces, and I could do her grilled pork skewers all day.

The Dee Dee trailer is sharing a lot with LA BBQ, on East Cesar Chavez next to Stay Gold and Drink's Lounge. This area was hopping on a Sunday afternoon, but it was easy to find street parking. They've been open less than a week, they're excited, we're excited for them, and you just want them to do well. If I run into you here, Thai Tea on me.
