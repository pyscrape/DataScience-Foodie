LOVE THE POSITIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! Everyone there is nice, <adj> helpful </adj> and caring. 
What's great is that for a new pok shop like themselves, they offer free samples if you're unsure which one to get. 
I was sharing a large "make your own" poke bowl with my boyfriend, & for the price you're paying & how much you're getting (with fresh quality sushi!!!!) is definitely worth it! This isn't like any of the other pok places I've tried, but right now this place is on top of my list. 
I don't normally like fruity deserts & honestly I didn't expect to like the dole whip they had. When I first had it, it was <adj> amazing </adj> !!! Its not too sweet, and the red stuff (idk what its called) perfectly balance the flavor. Definitely coming back! 

*UPDATE* 
I love one of the workers, her name is Kimberly I believe.  Her positivity and her smile go so well with the place. She def made my first visit to gopoke a <adj> memorable </>adj one! She was very <adj> helpful </adj> & patient helping me decide which pok to get since I've never been to gopok before.
