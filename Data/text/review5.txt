We went to Dee Dee last Wednesday or Thursday, and are already looking forward to our next trip! We parked in a neighborhood around the corner since this is on a busy street- just check signs and you should be good. 

We went early so there was no one else around eating yet, but the gentleman (owner?) at the window walked us through the menu. I mentioned my aversion to things to spicy and he gave me great suggestions and even asked his wife (I think? the one cooking!) to use less spice in my dish so I could enjoy it. 

My husband and I ordered the papaya salad and the Pad Ka Pow and we were really impressed. They were both so delicious- the papaya salad was so fresh and light on a brutally hot day, and the Pad Ka Pow was a serious kick of heat (when we added the extra hot sauce.) 

We wanted to try the mango rice but they said they weren't able to get good mango that day, but we're looking forward to trying it next time.

I was so happy they had La Croix as a beverage option, not just soda or water. 

Okay, I'm already getting hungry again just writing this. Do yourself a favor and go to Dee Dee now. They're nice people, the food is fresh and delicious, and what else do you need to know?
