I absolutely adore this place!

I first came here when it was relatively new and loved all the fusion dishes they offered here. I like to think that when restaurants offer "fusion asian" cuisine, it's because they actually took the time to develop a menu that contain dishes with different asian influences. Offering both thai food and korean food does not make it an asian fusion restaurant! 

Rant aside, I loved everything we ordered. They have a great selection, and I hope they don't make too many new changes! The caprisun pouchy alcoholic drinks were also fun and delicious. We came during happy hour, so they were only 5 bucks! I also secretly really wanted to keep the glowing ice cube..
