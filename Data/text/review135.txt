Went here for Happy Hour on a Wednesday night. It was decently busy, but not overcrowded or uncomfortable. 

The Good:

Great selection of wines and a nice cocktail menu. Plates are tapas style, which are great for those looking to share a variety of bites. 

We ordered the handmade gnocchi with black truffle oil and it was DIVINE. 10/10 would recommend. If I hadn't been on a first date, I would've eaten much faster and ordered another plate for myself. Plates are served with complimentary rustic bread and pesto-infused melted butter, which, again, I would've devoured much more rapidly had I not been on a first date. 

The other dishes that came out looked equally beautiful and well-prepared, so this is the perfect spot if you're looking for a quasi-bougie dinner at half the normal price with a nice drink to go along. 

The Bad:

The lighting is a little dim, which is good for first dates if you're feeling physically self-conscious (i.e., you'll be less visible) and bad for pretty much everything else, but that's the only knock I have on the place. At one point the tiny candle on our table for two went out, and I couldn't be certain my date was still across the table. Luckily our server was quick on the relight, and I was able to confirm that yes, he was still there. 

Good spot. I'd go again for happy hour wine and shareable, fancy food.
