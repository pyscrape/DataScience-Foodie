Top dollar for a top dollar experience. The service was incredibly accommodating and attentive, as expected for a fine dining experience. Though reservations were all full and booked through January, they were able to seat us in the lounge, and while we could not get the amazing view most people are probably trying to get, we were seated next to the charming pianist (Jason Lux) who really made our experience special. He not only conversed with us, but he also allowed for us to make several recommendations with an ability to play music spanning many different genres and styles. 

The food was incredible. My table agreed that the plate of the night was definitely the Dry-Aged Duck, and it was most definitely the best duck I have ever had. We also had the Pork and Wagyu New York Strip which were both delicious. The favorite appetizer was the Dungeness Crab, but the Oysters, Steak Tartare, and Foie Gras were also really tasty. As far as dessert goes, the Banana Mousse was my favorite, and while the Japanese Cheesecake and the Sorbet were both tasty, they weren't really that special (at least not for the price tag of the overall experience). Getting the Three Course option was enough to make me full, just right .
