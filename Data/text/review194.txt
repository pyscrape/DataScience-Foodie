Pappardelle alla bolognese was sheer delight! It was slightly spicy. Not overly sauced. The pasta was perfectly al dente. With my glass of house red and focaccia bread... Wowza!

It's a true bargain at $9 a plate when you consider it's all house made. This is the worst kept secret in town. And I love it!
