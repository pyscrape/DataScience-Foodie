Drinks were great but pricey. Had the smoked whiskey drink, which was interesting with it's smoke in a bottle as ice globe in the glass.

Service was great, though a bit absent... if we had needed anything we would have been out of luck.

All of our food was excellent. Seared tuna was like heaven on a fork! Shrimp tacos were tasty. Beef burger was simple but very tasty.

Mens room was nice and clean.
