Solid four stars at Second Bar + Kitchen. This restaurant is located conveniently across the JW Marriott and can get packed during dinner. We were promptly seated when we arrived around 6:30pm on a Thursday night.

Food wise, I would recommend what we tried - the soba noodles with sesame, mushrooms & avocado as well as the pork belly and poached eggs. The faroe island salmon had a delicious pork belly fried rice but the salmon was just slightly over cooked.  I had the green river cocktail. It was the first time I had a cocktail with green chartreuse (kinda herbaceous) and it was super delicious! There's a good variety in the menu that should suit a variety of palates.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Overall, a good experience here.
