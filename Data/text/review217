Wow. First time to Austin and this ended up being my favorite dinner spot. Ask for the dim sum cart menu (no, it's not the Asian type dim sum) and wait to try some of those items before you fill up on the regular menu. Complex creative flavors. Everything was fresh and delicious. Amazing cocktails too. I loved the interesting gin-based Army Navy which I think had a rice infusion -- fragrant and light cream taste without the cream. We also loved Hopdoddy Burgers and Launderette for an amazing Brunch!
