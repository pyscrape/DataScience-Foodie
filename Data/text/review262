Got the spicy salmon and bulgogi rice ball with the kichin fried chicken bowl. They hand make the rice ball right after you order it so it's really fresh. Comes with three sauces for dip. They have a lot of rice in them so it's pretty filling. The fried chicken was really crispy and not greasy at all. Good size portion and comes in these take out containers. There's only like 8 seats near the window so if there's space then you can eat there. 

Cons: I came around opening hours so they didn't have any drinks made yet. Also no hot drinks yet. Cashier guy told me they're looking to add hot drinks soon including matcha!

Def will come again when I'm in the area.
