This was my first time trying Korean tapas and it was exactly what I was looking for during happy hour. Not only do they have cheap drinks starting at $3 for a sapporo, but you get a free glass of beer if you check-in between 6-630pm. 

Entree: Their pork belly tacos were <adj> simply amazing </adj>, however, they are a bit pricy for the small portion that you do get. But, overall the tender meat and the addition of the perfect combination of sauces make it worth the price. My friend and I also got the kimchi paella, which had generous portions of both tiger shrimp and muscles inside the dish. The flavors of the cheese, kimchi, and seafood came together well and made it a delicious dish. While the portions of the taco were small, my friend and I found that one taco each and splitting an order of kimchi paella was filling enough.
