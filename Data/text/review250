Super happy with this place! Came here to celebrate the bachelorette party of a good friend and they put us in a huge booth by the window. Their cocktails are delicious and their food is incredibly well done. Plus it's helpful that a lot of their food doesn't have flour in it for GF folks like me.

Their cocktail menus are adorably kept in kids books, and their checks are brought to you in wallets. Everything about this place is super well thought out, and tastefully done. From endless cucumber water to perfect sized portions with the prices to match. This place place is a hit. 

Not to mention, the service was on point for a Friday night.
