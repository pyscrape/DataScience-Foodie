Great ambiance and service, average food and extremely overpriced. Do i regret going?no. Would I go back? no.
The main course (steak) very salty and salad dressing (which is supposed to be signature dish) was very ordinary. The wine list was also very limited (mostly US wine, limited French or Italian wines!)
