Really Cute Date Spot.

Located in a quiet Willow Glen.  I made reservations via Opentable.  We found street parking a couple of blocks away.  

We were greeted quickly and seated at a table for 2 with candle lit tables.  When we opted for the 3 course tasting menu, we were asked if we'd like to move to a larger table.  That seemed logical.  Until I noticed that it was the only table without a tablecloth and the table rocked.  That was a bit of a nuisance.

Our server was friendly.  3 course tasting menu and wine pairings.  So why 3 stars?  It was ups and downs.  I enjoyed the wine pairings and my wild boar pasta.  However, I really disliked my entree, the Salmon w/cherry glaze; it was too sweet.  However, I loved my dessert, the Affogato al Cafe, vanilla gelato w/a shot of espresso.

I'll have to give this place another try; maybe I just picked some of the wrong items.
