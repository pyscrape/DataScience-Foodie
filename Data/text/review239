On the main road at Willow Glen, small restaurant and bar, food is fresh and uses local sustainable  ingredients.  The prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and arugula was so fresh and the asparagus, wild mushrooms and truffle olive oil were both great starters.  Fresh rabbit slow cooked on a bed of polenta was outstanding, plentiful and the meat falls off the bone!  Coming back to explore more.
