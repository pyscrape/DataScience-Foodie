Alright. This place is BY far the best POKE place in Seattle. Daily shipment of Tuna from Hawaii to Seattle? Freshly cut and marinated for our mouths? What more can you ask. I was surprised by the texture of the tuna. I don't think I've ever had this kind of fresh tuna in my life. I guess the rest of the tuna places I go to, may that be Musashi or other sushi place around town, that their Tuna is previously frozen, but this place is DOPE. Side note, Salmon is from Vancouver, BC. 

My two friends and I got the King Size of two proteins, with goPoke Spicy Ahi and Spicy Aloli Salmon, and it fed us all for $18+T/T. Man, they give you so much fish! We had all the toppings we could get in our bowl. We also got their dole whip, and that was really good. Very similar to the Dole Plantation from Hawaii. 

Will be back for more poke. Prices vary from $11-15 for individual sizes, and King size is $5 more. I won't be surprised if the prices go up once they are more established.
