Really neat place just right off of all the main Broadway theaters.  Not too crowded when we first sat down but I guess once work let out the place got pretty packed.  I ordered the smoking reverend for a drink which was a bourbon and wine reduction with just a hint of antica that made it a wonderful pairing with my lamb burger. I also had tried the buffalo chicken spring rolls which were very unique and seemed like a pretty cool idea, may try to make these for a party hehe. 
Service was off the chart awesome, drinks came out quickly and the food not too long later. Servers were also very attentive and made sure the whole dining experience was great.  I would definitely recommend coming here if not for the good food then for the drinks which were all show themed.
