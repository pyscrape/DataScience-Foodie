i really loved our experience at emmer & rye.  the team has been in austin for two weeks now and we needed to let loose a little bit and get out of the domain where we've been staying / working. ive been asking around for the restaurant to try in austin right now, and this has consistently been at the top.  made reservations for 3 but unfortunately didnt know they had a patio, so we waited a bit for seating outside but were unsuccessful. oh well!  the space indoors is super chic and well appointed, so i didnt mind at all.  there is also bar seating, and kitchen counter seating where you can get see the entire kitchen in action. pretty awesome.

the menu is not extensive, but everything on it looked amazing. they recommend 2 dishes off the menu per person, then take a look at the dim sum cart items to supplement your meal. this worked out perfectly!  off the menu we got - fresh cheese with grain cracker, beef tartar, chicken roulade, short rib carnitas, and the cacio e pepe. amazing amazing flavors!  and the menu apparently changes daily!  off the dim sum cart we got - salad, fried pork, and shishito peppers.  the cocktails we ordered were also really yummy, and the server was knowledgeable about some very obscure italian wine and could tell us boatloads! i was super impressed.

all in all included the meal was about 200, totally reasonable. to be honest i havent had a bad meal in austin, but this might be top of the list. i left emmer & rye perfectly content, with warmth in my heart. the hospitality and service that i've received in austin really is something else!
