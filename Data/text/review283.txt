This is a great place! My friend and I were going to meet for a show and stopped in for lunch. First, we got a menu in Polish which we both weren't expecting! It shows how authentic it is. We decided on starting with Pierogis, mushroom, meat and of course, potato. They had a weekend special lunch menu in which I ordered a spinach and cheese stuffed turkey with mashed potatoes and cranberries. So delicious! And you can't forget their special beer. It's a splash of cranberry concentrate juice on their local Polish beer on tap. Everyone was ordering it and seemed very popular; it doesn't have a name though. So so good!
I definitely recommend coming here!:)
