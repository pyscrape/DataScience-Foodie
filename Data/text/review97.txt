What isn't to love about this place?! 

Food: deeeeelicious! I've had poke in Hawaii where it's the freshest, and this place is up to par in quality. They give generous amounts for what you pay, and the toppings just compliment the flavor of the seafood. My husband and I got the spicy tuna with Octopus in the side. It was enough to satisfy the both of us, which is saying a lot cuz we are some little piggies  There are other great selections here like bento boxes, siphon coffee, bubble tea,  Harney & Son's tea, etc. Next time we make our way back to NYC, I'd love to try it all!

Ambiance: sooooooo cute! I love all the Japanese mini decor & other artwork. It's clean, small (can fit about 15 people comfortably), and the workers are very sweet & friendly. It's a hidden gem inside Chinatown. 

Suggestions: would LOVE if this place sold gift cards because we want our New York friends to try this place! The gift of tantalized tastebuds & quality time can't be beat. They said they are working on it.
