Now that I've finally had dinner here, I wasn't too impressed. Service was great, and the area is perfect, however. So this is definitely a convenient and great spot to get food and drinks, but the food we had wasn't all too great in the taste department.

Black and bleu pizza: the best of our choices, you can't really go wrong with pizza
Petite green salad with shrimp: the shrimp was too salty, and the salad was pretty drenched
Brussel sprouts: too oily, greasy, and salty

Though our food choices weren't that great, everything else about this restaurant makes up for it!
