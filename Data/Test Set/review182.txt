we visited here during a <adj> popular </adj> friday lunch service and had <adj> high </adj> expectations for the restaurant's <adj> home-made </adj> pasta. we left <adj> disappointed </adj> but were still glad we had given the place a shot.

the pasta menu here changes from day to day. we ordered:

- papparadelle with <adj> ragu </adj> alla bolognese
- baked <adj> lasagna </adj> with <adj> sun </adj> gold tomatoes, summer squash, and toasted almond
- giardiniera (<adj> seasonal </adj> pickles)

<adj> overall </adj>, we thought the <adj> pasta </adj> here was way too <adj> thick </adj> - some people prefer <adj> thick </adj> <adj> pasta </adj>, but we were looking forward to thinner, more <adj> elastic </adj> <adj> pasta </adj>. the lasagna in <adj> particular </adj> was so <adj> thick </adj> that it was actually a bit <adj> hard </adj> to cut through, and the papparadelle was so <adj> thick </adj> and <adj> dry </adj> that it didn't really hang on to any of the sauce. the <adj> seasonal </adj> pickles were <adj> alright </adj>, but we would probably recommend skipping them considering how <adj> heavy </adj> the <adj> pasta </adj> dishes were.
