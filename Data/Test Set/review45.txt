What GoPoke does well: aloha spirit, the staff that was aiding me and my friends was above it. They are on a whole new level of customer service. Claps for the time they took to let me sample, make a choice, and learn about all the toppings. I appreciated not being expected to rush despite how busy they were. The actual taste of the poke was <adj> delicious </adj>, healthy portions, and quality. Best bowl I've had in Seattle yet. To really just make a pleasure filled experience that much better the staff brought over 3 pineapple desserts complete with the li hi moi powder, and gummies. Also Points for how fast I saw the line grow, then die down because your staff keep it moving. 

If I could give them higher, I'd 6 star it. From the group that I came with to your staff, if you read this, thank you. You made the first visit a return one. 

What GoPoke can work on: the parking. That was the only killer.
