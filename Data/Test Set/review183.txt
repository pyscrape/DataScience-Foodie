<adj> big </adj> fan of <adj> il </adj> corvo. <adj> great </adj> portion sized pastas (not too <adj> much </adj>, not too <adj> little </adj>) for $9. the venue is <adj> super </adj> <adj> small </adj> which explains the <adj> long </adj> lines out the door. expect to wait at <adj> least </adj> 30 mins (on a <adj> good </adj> day). not to worry though, they have a <adj> great </adj> system of getting food out within minutes of ordering (a-).

on my most <adj> recent </adj> visit, me and my friends ordered all three options of pasta which included a pappardelle w <adj> bolognese </adj> sauce, "<adj> di </adj> verdure" lasagne, and a <adj> pesto </adj> dish. keep in mind that they're always rotating the pastas out. we also ordered the focaccia, which is really a must when visiting il corvo. i have yet to try their <adj> kale </adj> salad though, but it looks like a <adj> great </adj> option. their pappardelle is pretty regularly on the menu and definitely a <adj> great </adj> choice, but i really enjoyed their <adj> vegetarian </adj> lasagne. i loved the pieces of squash and just the flavor in <adj> general </adj>. there's a reason why il corvo is so <adj> popular </adj>, definitely check it out for yourself!
