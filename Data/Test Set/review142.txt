we came here for dinner and it was pretty <adj> good </adj>. the <adj> fried </adj> pickle appetizer was amazing. i ordered a burger ($14) and apparently the 1/4 cup of fries were <adj> extra </adj> because i was charged $17 for the burger. kind of annoying. my husband had the <adj> black </adj> and <adj> bleu </adj> pizza and it was so <adj> rich </adj> but <adj> good </adj>. he could only finish half of it.

hostess looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. server was <adj> good </adj> and made some <adj> nice </adj> recommendations. soda was served from a can. decent beer list, <adj> nice </adj> outdoor patio. it was <adj> good </adj> but i wasn't blown away.
