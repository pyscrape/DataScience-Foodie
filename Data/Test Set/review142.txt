We came here for dinner and it was pretty good. The fried pickle appetizer was amazing. I ordered a burger ($14) and apparently the 1/4 cup of fries were extra because I was charged $17 for the burger. Kind of annoying. My husband had the black and bleu pizza and it was SO rich but good. He could only finish half of it.

Hostess looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. Server was good and made some nice recommendations. Soda was served from a can. Decent beer list, nice outdoor patio. It was good but I wasn't blown away.
