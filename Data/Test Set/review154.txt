i was in town for acl and had brunch here on a sunday ... my fatass ordered a <adj> bloody </adj> mary to start, the avocado fundido ($12) and the congress burger with <adj> truffle </adj> fries ($14 - $4 for the <adj> truffle </adj> fries).  the <adj> truffle </adj> fries were pretty <adj> good </adj>, crispy on the outside and had a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> truffle </adj> flavor.  the avocado fundido was something <adj> different </adj>!  house chorizo in a <adj> mini </adj> skillet with avocado and queso asadero melted on top, along with <adj> chipotle </adj> corn chips.  usually i like everything pretty <adj> seasoned </adj>, but i thought the chips had a bit too <adj> much </adj> seasoning on them (it became pretty salty on some chips).  but <adj> overall </adj>, this was a <adj> solid </adj> spot to eat and i had leftovers which eventually went to waste in the <adj> hot </adj> heat :(.  if this was in <adj> new </adj> york i would come back again :)
