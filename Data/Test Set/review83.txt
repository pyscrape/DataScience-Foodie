quality than quantity, but not a <adj> bad </adj> deal.

i've been so spoiled from another poke spot on <adj> canal </adj> st. they're <adj> expensive </adj> and portion is <adj> small </adj>. but the quality satisfies my craving for <adj> good </adj> food. simple is very <adj> generous </adj> and <adj> honest </adj> food. my spicy tuna (with <adj> white </adj> rice and sesame seeds) for $10 is a bargain --  look at my photo. not only it is a <adj> beautiful </adj> and <adj> packed </adj> <adj> full </adj> of goodies in a bowl, it's <adj> enough </adj> for two meals.
