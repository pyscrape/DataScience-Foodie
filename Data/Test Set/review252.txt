This review is for the wonderful atmosphere and service, I did not eat here. My favorite thing about this bar is the atmosphere - it is absolutely fabulous! The decor is classy and classic yet still casual, the colors are warm and inviting , there's outdoor seating some parts of the year, the tables are not squished together, some really cool decorative touches (such as a couple 1930's desk lamps on the bar), bar service is friendly and relaxed, highly knowledgeable bartenders, massive variety of liquors, creative and exotic cocktails (kind of fun to sit at the bar and watch them being made) - it's a very comfortable place to spend an hour or two.
