two words: <adj> dole </adj> whip. make that three words: <adj> dole </adj> whip float.

<adj> i </adj> <adj> last </adj> <adj> ate </adj> <adj> dole </adj> whip when <adj> i </adj> was in <adj> oahu </adj> 5 years ago, and eating it again at gopoke brought back all the <adj> great </adj> memories from my time there with mr. w.  gopoke's <adj> dole </adj> whip float is a <adj> beautiful </adj> concoction of <adj> dole </adj> whip, <adj> pineapple </adj> juice, and <adj> pineapple </adj> pieces...the <adj> best </adj> part is that it's adorned with <adj> <adj> delicious </adj> </adj> <adj> li </adj> hing powder. <adj> i </adj> love <adj> li </adj> hing; <adj> i </adj> love it. if you've never had <adj> li </adj> hing before, it is salty, sweet, and sour. it gives me life and brings the fuzzies, because <adj> i </adj> would always eat <adj> li </adj> hing mui with my grandma when <adj> i </adj> was a kid. 

onto the poke -- this fish is <adj> fresh </adj>! i ordered a <adj> salmon </adj> poke bowl with <adj> white </adj> rice, <adj> ocean </adj> salad, furikake, and pickled ginger. there are a lot of topping options and sides on the menu, but i like to keep it <adj> simple </adj>. the <adj> salmon </adj> was <adj> well-marinated </adj>. i tasted soy, sesame, some chilis, <adj> sweet </adj> onions, but i could still taste the <adj> salmon </adj> itself. it was a bit on the salty side for me, but the rice helps to neutralize that. the portion of the protein was <adj> smaller </adj> than i'm used to at my <adj> usual </adj> poke spot, but i like the flavors of the <adj> salmon </adj> marinade here. 

the people who work here are so <adj> endearing </adj> and warm . they made my friends and i felt looked after and welcomed. they enbodied that "<adj> aloha </adj> spirit."

btw, they have spam musubi and bubbies!! <adj> i </adj> should have ordered those, but <adj> i </adj> thought <adj> i </adj> was going to be too <adj> full </adj> from poke and <adj> dole </adj> whip. ugh..regrets.
