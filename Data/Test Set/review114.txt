I love this bar lounge near Times Square.  The Yelp reviews were right on target.   Nice drink menu with some specialty cocktails. I tried several but the Mule was my favorite by a long shot.   I also tried several appetizers and they were all great.  The devil eggs were definitely the star of the night!  The tuna appetizer was also super.  I will be coming back here every time I come to New York.  Small and intimate setting.  Nice background music playing.
