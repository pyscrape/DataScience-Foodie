<adj> i </adj> had no idea what emmer was until <adj> i </adj> dined at emmer and rye! if you can appreciate milling your <adj> own </adj> flour, handmade pasta and <adj> local/garden </adj> produce, then this is your spot. 

grab a <adj> few </adj> <adj> shareable </adj> bites from the menu and dave room to order off the dim sum carts. you'll probably want to grab <adj> 2-3 </adj> dishes per person. 

i had the field pea hummus that is <adj> super </adj> creamy and will convert you to your <adj> non </adj> <adj> traditional </adj> hummus pretty <adj> quick </adj>. 

the <adj> grilled </adj> squash and zucchini salad with onion petals and roasted garlic was so <adj> fresh </adj>, <adj> colorful </adj> and <adj> fragrant </adj>. 

the strozzapretti it's <adj> confit </adj> chicken, chili, <adj> garlic </adj>, mushroom and basil was amazing (could have been <adj> lighter </adj> on the butter). but, i loved this dish and would get it again! 

save room for dessert because you'll want to order the <adj> seasonal </adj> ice cream sandwich. when we went, it was the <adj> rosemary </adj> ice cream sandwich with a koji cookie and <adj> fig </adj> preserve. wow! <adj> i </adj> <adj> wish </adj> <adj> i </adj> had my <adj> own </adj> and didn't have to share! 

the staff are so <adj> attentive </adj> and the ambience is <adj> chill </adj>, <adj> naturey </adj> and <adj> modern </adj> with a <adj> fresh </adj> vibe.
