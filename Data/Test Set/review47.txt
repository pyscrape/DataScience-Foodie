Ever since I saw the sign that goPok would be opening in the ID, I incessantly stalked their social media pages. The grand opening weekend was definitely "grand." The line was over an hour wait in chilly weather. Staff members came out to bring samples of pok and dole whips. Yum! Everyone was in a pretty good mood and those who couldn't hang left the line to eat elsewhere. Staff members are <adj> friendly</adj> and always on the move. 

A few things set goPok apart from others. First, ahi is flown in daily from Hawaii. Second, the pok is marinated. Yes, it's true! That adds deeper flavor to the overall experience. Third, it expensive, but worth it. Finally, they have dessert! 

The quality of the fish is obvious when you take your first bite. The texture and the flavor assure you that the fish is very fresh. The topping bar has just the right amount of the right ingredients such as crab salad, seaweed salad, edamame and the other usual suspects. I only eat ahi pok and this is the best quality I've tasted in awhile. I've tried the bowls and burritos; both are <adj> excellent </adj>. 

I'm a sucker for dessert and always try to convince business owners to invest in this critical aspect. goPok has shave ice, Dole whips, and Bubbies mochi ice cream. The shave ice is <adj> decent </adj> and I know I'll be back for more since it's hard to find good shave ice in Seattle. I'm not a fan of pineapple but always eat Dole whips. I haven't tried the Dole whip floats yet but they look as yummy as they sound. Either way, I have to get li hing mui powder on it!
