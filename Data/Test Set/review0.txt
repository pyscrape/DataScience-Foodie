in the four years <adj> i </adj>'ve lived in austin, <adj> i </adj> can count maybe two or three places that <adj> i </adj> enjoy enough to eat at regularly. but now dee dee has officially become my <adj> favorite </adj> place to eat in this city. <adj> deeeeelicious </adj>, <adj> authentic </adj>, <adj> northern </adj> <adj> thai </adj> street food. <adj> i </adj> love it so <adj> much </adj> that <adj> i </adj> actually get cravings for this food every couple weeks. my <adj> go-to </adj> dish is the <adj> pad </adj> kapow: spicy stir fried ground pork with <adj> thai </adj> basil, <adj> cold </adj> cucumber, fried egg, and a bed of <adj> steamed </adj> jasmine rice. plus on the side they include a side of chili <adj> fish </adj> sauce, which you pour over the <adj> whole </adj> thing. man, it's so <adj> good </adj>! <adj> i </adj>'m drooling just thinking about it. <adj> i </adj>'m also a fan of the som <adj> tom </adj> dish. it has <adj> fresh </adj> papaya, tomatoes, <adj> green </adj> beans, peanuts, <adj> fish </adj> sauce, and <adj> thai </adj> chilis. oh and you can't forget about their <adj> thai </adj> iced <adj> tea </adj> - so refreshing and not too <adj> sweet </adj>!

i lived in the <adj> san </adj> francisco bay area for <adj> many </adj> years, so consider my standards for <adj> ethnic </adj> food to be pretty <adj> high </adj>. time and time again, <adj> austin </adj> ranks very <adj> low </adj> in my book. <adj> most </adj> of the <adj> ethnic </adj> food in this town is either bland or too <adj> salty </adj> and <adj> greasy </adj>, not to mention overpriced. dee dee on the <adj> other </adj> hand is the <adj> real </adj> deal. i hope they turn this place into a brick and mortar. <adj> austin </adj> really is in <adj> dire </adj> need of some <adj> good </adj> food like this!
