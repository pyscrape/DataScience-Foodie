In the four years I've lived in Austin, I can count maybe two or three places that I enjoy enough to eat at regularly. But now Dee Dee has officially become my favorite place to eat in this city. Deeeeelicious, authentic, northern Thai street food. I love it so much that I actually get cravings for this food every couple weeks. My go-to dish is the Pad Kapow: spicy stir fried ground pork with Thai basil, cold cucumber, fried egg, and a bed of steamed jasmine rice. Plus on the side they include a side of chili fish sauce, which you pour over the whole thing. Man, it's so good! I'm drooling just thinking about it. I'm also a fan of the Som Tom dish. It has fresh papaya, tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, fish sauce, and Thai chilis. Oh and you can't forget about their Thai iced tea - so refreshing and not too sweet!

I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for many years, so consider my standards for ethnic food to be pretty high. Time and time again, Austin ranks very low in my book. Most of the ethnic food in this town is either bland or too salty and greasy, not to mention overpriced. Dee Dee on the other hand is the real deal. I hope they turn this place into a brick and mortar. Austin really is in dire need of some good food like this!
