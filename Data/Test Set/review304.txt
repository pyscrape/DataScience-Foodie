came here because <adj> i </adj> read so much on their royales. so of course, <adj> i </adj> tried the hibiscus and rose. both were <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> sweet </adj>, but not overbearing. the space is <adj> small </adj> (as anywhere in l.e.s.), but past the bar there are <adj> high </adj> tops with <adj> more </adj> room. we shared the <adj> 2-cheese </adj> plate (baguettes, grapes, walnuts) and the country liver pat (baguettes, pickles). both were <adj> great </adj> starters. then came the beef sliders (2), which were so <adj> yummy </adj>. just wish there had been at <adj> least </adj> one <adj> more </adj> for the $15 price tag. we finished up with the croque monsieur, which by far was the <adj> best </adj> tasting and <adj> best </adj> bang for your buck. it's a <adj> traditional </adj> croque monsieur, cut into four <adj> generous </adj> pieces. <adj> i </adj> couldn't get enough. service is <adj> sweet </adj> and <adj> simple </adj>. would love to come back.
