Delicious food. I am polish and love to go try out various polish restaurants. Karczma is definitely one of my favorites. I loved their zurek in a bowl. The zurek is made completely different than the way my family makes it, but was so good. 
My mom and I ordered the grill plate for 2... but I think it can be for 3 people or even 4. It is such a big plate! 
Don't forget to order "hot" beer and wine. You will not be disappointed.
