<adj> delicious </adj> food. i am <adj> polish </adj> and love to go try out <adj> various </adj> <adj> polish </adj> restaurants. karczma is definitely one of my favorites. i loved their zurek in a bowl. the zurek is made completely <adj> different </adj> than the way my family makes it, but was so <adj> good </adj>. 
my mom and <adj> i </adj> ordered the grill plate for 2... but <adj> i </adj> think it can be for 3 people or even 4. it is <adj> such </adj> a <adj> big </adj> plate! 
don't forget to order "<adj> hot </adj>" beer and wine. you will not be disappointed.
