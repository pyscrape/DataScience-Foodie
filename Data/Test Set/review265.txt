I've been trying to get over here since the start of summer and today it finally happened! Grabbed lunch here on a whim with some coworkers and it totally met all expectations.

I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and a small side of the Korean fried chicken (in case you haven't seen my recent reviews, I have a new obsession). I was hesitant to order the bibimbap to-go since the stone bowl is such an enjoyable part of the experience but nonetheless, this was still really great. I'm glad I asked for a side of some type of spicy sauce because it took this dish to the next level. 

If you're ordering pickup/to-go, I suggest calling it in as it does take a little bit of time to prepare. The interior is small so I wouldn't recommend it for eat-in if you're more than a party of 2, maybe 3.
