<adj> i </adj> was a <adj> bit </adj> <adj> skeptical </adj> of this <adj> joint </adj> when <adj> i </adj> first walked in. its a <adj> small </adj> dainty place in chinatown, not actually known for its <adj> fresh </adj> fish. however once <adj> i </adj> tried the poke bowl, all expectations were blown out of the water. 

<adj> many </adj> poke <adj> bowls </adj> require you to pay <adj> extra </adj> for avocado which makes your <adj> bowl </adj> $13 - dollars. at <adj> simple </adj>, it already comes with <adj> delicious </adj> topping and a <adj> guacamole </adj> smash that is absolutely <adj> delicious </adj>. the fish was <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj>. the <adj> only </adj> thing that i wasn't too <adj> happy </adj> about what the amount of toppings, because they give you a little too <adj> much </adj>. 

this place is <adj> super </adj> <adj> affordable </adj> and gives you a <adj> big </adj> bang for your buck!
