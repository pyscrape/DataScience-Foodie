i was getting brunch with a bunch of friends who were all coming from <adj> different </adj> directions. in need of a location easy for everyone to get to, <adj> second </adj> bar and kitchen popped up on yelp. this restaurant is part of a hotel, so you instantly get the swanky, <adj> trendy </adj> feel. we all sat <adj> outside </adj> and brunched to our tummy's delight.

sometimes, when <adj> i </adj> go out for brunch and yogurt is on the menu as a side or appetizer, the portion is often <adj> large </adj> enough to be totally filling for my breakfast needs. seeing this place had grilled pineapple and strawberry salad (which came with yogurt), <adj> i </adj> thought it would be the <adj> same </adj>. the waiter warned me the portion is <adj> small </adj>...like an <adj> actual </adj> appetizer portion, so <adj> i </adj> asked if <adj> i </adj> could make it a <adj> double </adj>, and <adj> double </adj> it they did! it was <adj> great </adj>, <adj> fresh </adj>, <adj> sweet </adj>, and doubling the portion was an <adj> excellent </adj> idea. my friend who ordered the texas benedict was one <adj> happy </adj> camper, as was the person who ordered the breakfast plate. <adj> other </adj> things heard around the table: <adj> black </adj> truffle grits are <adj> great </adj>, coffee is <adj> bottomless </adj>, and get your latte with 2% milk.

<adj> overall </adj>, we had a <adj> great </adj> time here and the <adj> perfect </adj> outdoor dining weather certainly helped!
