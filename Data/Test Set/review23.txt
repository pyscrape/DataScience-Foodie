We decided to celebrate our anniversary here on NYE. We just had to do it one time for the one time. The service, the view, the overall experience was just amazing. We had the early dinner seating, waited in the bar/lounge area. I was kinda worried that they wouldn't be able to find me since I only checked in with one person who didn't even check me off anywhere, but minutes later, a hostess [who magically knew our party name] approached us to welcome us to our table. Very nice. 

It was a 5-course set menu. I thought the portions were the perfect size to be able to fully enjoy and appreciate each course rather than trying to stuff huge dishes down my throat, trying to taste everything. Our menu included the aebelskiver [reminded me of a doughnut hole, it was really nice and dainty], butternut squash soup, carrot soup [it was served cold, very interesting. My boyfriend hated it but i thought it was unique lol], lobster, wagyu ribeye and a chocolate truffle dessert.

My favorite dish would have to be the lobster. It was so fresh and buttery, the best lobster I've ever tasted! It was also my boyfriend's favorite, which is saying a lot since he doesn't even like lobster. He almost gave me his dish when it came! 

I thought the service was impeccable. Our servers took the time to give us information about each dish after they were brought out to us. Our main server, I think his name was Dominic, I'm soo sorry if it isn't! I thought he was so warm and welcoming, and funny too! 

And I guess Canlis is known for their valet?? No they didn't take down our names or give us a ticket when we gave them our car, and yes they gave us back the right car :) Super cool.
