disappointing customer service.
we went here to celebrate my husband's birthday.  the food was ok.  the server was <adj> nice </adj>.  but what really <adj> sours </adj> my experience was i found a <adj> dirty </adj> piece of <adj> hard </adj> metal in my left-overs!  since i don't live close to the restaurant, i called them to let them know what happened.  i asked for the manger to call me back.  it's been a week and no follow-up from the restaurant.  i would've thought they would want to see the metal object so they can determine if this was an <adj> isolated </adj> incident or not.  i even wrote them a letter and included the metal piece--still no response.  really very <adj> disappointing </adj> that this place doesn't care about the safety of it's diners!
