If you go here and have the homemade pasta, I dare you to write a review lower than 5 stars. You can't do it. It's too delicious. It's like pillows of heaven in your mouth. And I've been to Italy. In fact, I lived there. In Firenze, by the duomo in centro (that's for the naysayers). 

So, go find your friend who says "I should know because I know good Italian food" when they're from like Indiana or Chicago or something and have never been to Italy nor are Italian (everyone has one of those friends *eye roll*), and take them here. And if they don't like it, then ask them if they like peanut butter or unicorns or puppies, because they probably don't. And you can unfriend them. In real life. Cuz you don't need that kind of negativity. 

On a related note, the wine list is great too, as is the customer service. 10/10, would recommend.
