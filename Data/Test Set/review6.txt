amazing <adj> authentic </adj> <adj> flavorful </adj> <adj> northern </adj> <adj> thai </adj>  street food coming out of a food truck. we were <adj> hungry </adj> and <adj> impatient </adj> and didn't want to wait in the line for la barbeque so ditched the line and went to dee dee.  

the food is prepared <adj> fresh </adj> when you order it by the husband and wife team who are the owners.  we tried the <adj> larb </adj> moo, pad kapow, and <adj> om </adj> gai. all three were <adj> delicious </adj> and very <adj> spicey </adj>!  the <adj> larb </adj> moo and <adj> om </adj> gai were served with <adj> delicious </adj> <adj> sticky </adj> rice patties that you could break off and dip in the food.  there was no warnings that the default <adj> spice </adj> level is <adj> lip </adj> burning <adj> hot </adj>!  i usually get <adj> medium </adj> <adj> spice </adj> at restaurants, and this was even <adj> hot </adj> for me.  they didn't even ask us what <adj> spice </adj> level we would prefer.  knowing this <adj> next </adj> time i will be <adj> sure </adj> to request the <adj> spice </adj> to be turned down a level or two.

the thai iced tea unfortunately used creamer and not coconut milk. although my husband still enjoyed the flavor.  

i have been looking for <adj> delicious </adj> mango <adj> sticky </adj> rice and i have finally found it!  the mango <adj> sticky </adj> rice is the <adj> real </adj> deal here.  it is the <adj> best </adj> that i have had since being in thailand.  melted in your mouth, ripe, and not too <adj> sweet </adj>.  perfection.
