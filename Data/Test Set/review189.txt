this <adj> little </adj> restaurant is located in pioneer square and although they don't have <adj> personal </adj> parking. there is a <adj> paid </adj> parking lot just down the street. if that's a no go, there is also a parking garage not much further down. 

my friends and <adj> i </adj> went on a <adj> friday </adj> afternoon and as expected there was a <adj> short </adj> line that had formed outside the door. we maybe waited <adj> 5-10 </adj> minutes outside in the <adj> chilly </adj> weather until we finally stepped inside the <adj> warm </adj> and <adj> wonderful </adj> aroma filled restaurant. even though it was extremely packed the atmosphere felt <adj> content </adj>. waiting in line and watching everyone eat made me so excited to order my <adj> own </adj> plate! except my <adj> inner </adj> <adj> fat </adj> kid was telling me, one?! how can you choose just one?! get all three christina, do it!! so <adj> hell </adj> yeah <adj> i </adj> got three pasta dishes (usually only 3 on the menu that changes up daily). don't worry <adj> i </adj> didn't intake all those <adj> delicious </adj> carbs myself, <adj> i </adj> had my <adj> boyfriend </adj> share with me. 

after my group and <adj> i </adj> ordered from the <adj> sweet </adj> lady at the counter we sat down and it only took a <adj> few </adj> minutes for all the plates to arrive. <adj> quick </adj>! everyone take your pics pronto and let's dig innn. which we did, and okay this is where <adj> i </adj> try <adj> fresh </adj> "<adj> al </adj> dente" pasta for the <adj> first </adj> time and make the mistake of thinking it was over cooked. not gonna lie <adj> i </adj> always thought <adj> al </adj> dente just meant once it's <adj> soft </adj> it's cooked and <adj> ready </adj>! yeah no, it actually means firm when bitten. <adj> honest </adj> mistake really, so <adj> i </adj> was definitely confused until some of my friends informed me of this.

once <adj> i </adj> got over that life altering moment <adj> i </adj> thoroughly enjoyed switching my plates around to the lasagna, pappardelle alla bolognese, and <adj> pesto </adj> cornetti. taking in every bite <adj> i </adj> found the lasagna to be my <adj> absolute </adj> <adj> favorite </adj> and hello there wasn't even any meat in it. that bechamel sauce was everythaang. my boyfriend's <adj> favorite </adj> was the pappardelle cause he likes meat and he loves having some spice in his life. we both agreed though that the cornetti was our <adj> least </adj> <adj> favorite </adj> and even though it was cheesy it had quite an <adj> earthy </adj> taste to it. <adj> i </adj>'d say the <adj> whole </adj> grain and arugula had a lot to do with that <adj> distinct </adj> flavor that wasn't quite hitting the spot for us. 

after our friends cheered us on to finish the <adj> last </adj> bites of our carb overload we bounced so <adj> other </adj> pasta lovers could get a taste of the deliciousness. thanks <adj> ll </adj> corvo, keep doing you boo.
