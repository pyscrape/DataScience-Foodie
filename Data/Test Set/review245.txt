i've been craving to try this place! came here for <adj> happy </adj> hour with some friends and we ordered up a storm. tried the <adj> following </adj> items:

half dozen oysters ($7): <adj> great </adj> quality, comes with a side of horseradish and a vinegar sauce that both complemented it well, very <adj> fresh </adj>!
herb & bitter salad ($7): we were craving some <adj> healthy </adj> <adj> fresh </adj> salad but it was slightly on the salty side. could have tasted way better without as <adj> much </adj> salt.
gambas al ajillo ($9): the shrimp portions were extremely <adj> generous </adj> and it was very <adj> tasty </adj>. comes with a side of bread which helps complement the <adj> different </adj> spices the shrimp are cooked in
<adj> wild </adj> boar meatballs with <adj> mole </adj> sauce ($9): i honestly think that was my <adj> least </adj> <adj> favorite </adj> dish, we could have done without this one. the meatballs weren't very tender and were very <adj> generic </adj>, the sauce was <adj> ok </adj> but wasn't anything <adj> special </adj>
calamari (not part of <adj> happy </adj> hour): boy were these <adj> delicious </adj>, we ended up getting 3 servings for the table, that's how <adj> much </adj> we loved it! but how can you go <adj> wrong </adj> with <adj> fried </adj> calamari!

drinks: we absolutely loved their drinks. the bartenders here are <adj> fabulous </adj> and the custom make drinks based on what tastes you enjoy. i do enjoy myself a bourbon sour from time to time and i requested it with bullet and they made it to complete perfection.

<adj> overall </adj>, i can definitely say i will be coming back!
