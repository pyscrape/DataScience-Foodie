was at rei and wanted to try tapas in seattle for the <adj> first </adj> time. found this place on yelp.

pros:
- excellent service
-- the 3 bartenders were doing work! hustling, cleaning, doing dishes, making drinks and running plates constantly.
- the decor. the finishes in this place are gorg. the metal ceiling, skylights, and the <adj> bubble </adj> photos on the walls... very ritzy and well thought-out. 
- everything we ordered was <adj> delicious </adj>.
-- king salmon. nutty, spicy and <adj> fresh </adj>.
-- gnocci. the sauce and mushrooms on this are heaven.
-- shrub and... blackberry? hubby loved it!
-- cucumber water

cons:
- the noise in the <adj> back </adj> patio. i felt like my ears would start bleeding, and if they hadn't had a place for us at the far end of the bar, we would've left. this is not a place to go for an intimate date night.
