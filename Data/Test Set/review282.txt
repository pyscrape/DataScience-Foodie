As soon as I walked in to get my nails polished, I realized I had made a bad mistake and this place was probably more of a restaurant than the salon I was looking for. Never one to turn away from a good adventure, I sat down anyway to try out some food. The previous sentences are not true, besides sitting down to try out some food, FYI.

We started with two appetizers: goulash soup, which was tiny but also excellent, and pirogues (sp?) which were delicious and if you've ever had fake pirogues, this is what they're actually supposed to taste like apparently. High recommendations.

Then we got the goulash for dinner and it was awesome and I also said "hearty" about 40 times. It was delightful. Filling food is good food, and those Eastern Europeans know how to keep themselves filled. We also got the Polish specialty plate, which had everything I never knew I wanted to try and was fantastic.

If you want to get your nails polished, stay away. If you want to get your Polish food, go here!
