We came in for dinner on Friday night to find the restaurant completely filled. Luckily, there was a short wait, so we started off at the bar. I had a Hofbrau Dunkel and then a grzaniec - a polish mulled beer with honey and cinnamon. I'd recommend trying the grzaniec.

We started with the white borscht. It was the perfect warmer on a cold night. The soup is served in a bread bowl which makes the dish very filling. It's definitely ideal to share it.

For the main course, we shared the polish platter which had pierogies, kielbasa, latkes, and stuffed cabbage. The platter is a great way to sample several polish specialities. 

All in all, it's a great restaurant for both small and large groups. The atmosphere was lively, and the staff was attentive.
