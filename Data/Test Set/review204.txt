A Few First Impressions:

Adam is a serious yet quick with a smile helpful manager. His beer recs for my man were spot on.
Zack is the fastest moving bartender in Austin. 
The interior is gorgeous. I love the neutral tones and unique spaces with the high and low tables. 
Sunday Dim Sum is slightly odd but unique. It interrupted our conversation but I think that should be expected. The one or two items we selected were delicious!
The lamb dish was amazing. It did not have a wild flavor and tasted more like a pulled pork.
The beet concoction was insanely and quantifiably fabulous! Just trust me.
