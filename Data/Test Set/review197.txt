we got there <adj> less </adj> than 15 minutes after they opened on a friday, and yes there was a <adj> humungo </adj> line, and even though we waited for almost an hour, the <adj> whole </adj> time i was <adj> like </adj> <adj> omgomgstare-at-other-peoples-foodomgomgomg </adj> and then we finally made it to the front and we were <adj> like </adj> <adj> omgomgomg </adj> one of each omgomg and a bread too, and <adj> omgomgomg </adj> <adj> yay </adj> seat opened and <adj> omgomgomg </adj> glad to see the cashier was totally used to this kinda <adj> googly-eyed </adj> <adj> foodie </adj> behavior. 

seriously why would you wait an hour and not get all three? 9$. even if it was just myself eating. it baffles me how people have any sort of self-control when it comes to something so <adj> beautiful </adj> as <adj> il </adj> corvo pasta. 

i'm not going to pretend i know any <adj> italian </adj> - there was <adj> brown </adj> <adj> tubey </adj> meat pasta, <adj> purple </adj> beet sunset pasta, and <adj> green </adj> pesto snake pasta that was so <adj> cool </adj>. and <adj> soooo </adj> <adj> good </adj>. like there was maybe 3 pastas in there... look at the texture of this thing. 

everything was amazing. except the bread which was spongey but ok. wished i saved more room for pasta. god i miss the place. why can't more <adj> italian </adj> places be like this!?
