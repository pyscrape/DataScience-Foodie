Cute place with great service.  My well-cooked pasta carbonara was very rich with tons of small pancetta cubes.  Eat it with a spoon; otherwise you'll have all pasta then all pancetta no matter how well you mix it. My wife's butternut squash ravioli was delicious, though you only get three big ones. Unless the waiter ate one on his way to our table.  The bread to start came with butter instead of oil and vinegar.  As for the bruschetta... someone says the owner puts his love into the food... well, then he must HATE the BRUSCHETTA's GUTS.  The bread is Betty White in a desert dry (ours was a little burnt) with hardly a basil or garlic presence.  I wouldn't get it again.

Returned a second time because the Groupon deal is pretty amazing.  My meal was so good I bumped my review up a star from 3 to 4.  The pinotThe Arancini Di Riso are riceballs that are more a hot cheesy goo than rice inside some fried balls, with meat sauce. The riceballs and amazeballs.  Only two entrees were an additional $5, which was super rare.  Because of this I got the most expensive dish, the Farfalle Ai Crostacei (farfalle pasta, shrimp, lobster meat & crab meat sauteed with vodka, cream, louisana spices and marinara).  It appropriately has the initials F.A.C. because this rich, creamy, meat dish was FACing great.
