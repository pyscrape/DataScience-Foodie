<adj> last </adj> night my girlfriend treated me to barley swine for veterans day. we frequent their sister location, <adj> odd </adj> duck, and we go to uchiko and uchi fairly often as well. i will be straightforward and get the <adj> negative </adj> things out of the way first.

 i was disappointed they weren't offering anything to veterans, and we should've just gone to odd duck, because they were offering a <adj> free </adj> burger.

also, neither one of us to super excited about our cocktails, but the homemade soda was <adj> perfect </adj> (and it's something we get at <adj> odd </adj> duck every time as well).

but besides that, the food was absolutely <adj> excellent </adj>. artistically presented, <adj> full </adj> of flavor, and perfectly cooked. we both enjoyed the duck the most, and while i initially thought the akaushi was over <adj> seasoned </adj>, the <adj> sweet </adj> corn puree hid that if you ate it together, which was the point.

all in all, 4/5 for the <adj> entire </adj> experience, but 5 for the food.
