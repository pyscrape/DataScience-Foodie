absolutely <adj> delicious </adj> and <adj> inventive </adj> food. the food is <adj> small </adj> plates that are <adj> creative </adj> and <adj> farm-to-table </adj>. even brought out a blanket when the night turned chilly! there is a <adj> modern </adj> but <adj> cozy </adj> <adj> indorr </adj> area dominated by the bar, and a <adj> nice </adj> outdoor patio. it's not a very <adj> big </adj> place, so it could get crowded and there could be a wait on <adj> popular </adj> evenings (like friday and saturday). <adj> great </adj> service and very <adj> knowledgeable </adj> server. two of us had a couple of cocktails and five <adj> small </adj> plates plus two desserts for about $100.
