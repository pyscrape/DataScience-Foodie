Absolutely delicious and inventive food. The food is small plates that are creative and farm-to-table. Even brought out a blanket when the night turned chilly! There is a modern but cozy indorr area dominated by the bar, and a nice outdoor patio. It's not a very big place, so it could get crowded and there could be a wait on popular evenings (like Friday and Saturday). Great service and very knowledgeable server. Two of us had a couple of cocktails and five small plates plus two desserts for about $100.
