One name: Marco.

My friends took me here during my first night in Seattle & advised how amazing the bar is.  They said, "tell Marco what you like and he'll make you something delicious".  At first you might think they're exaggerating until you actually order with him.
While my request was fairly easy during my first visit- "Jameson Mule but not quite a mule".  He killed it in the best way possible.  My friend's request was a little more complicated- "vodka or rum based, little spicy, not too sweet, and has to be balanced".  He did just that!  The spicy drink was smooth, balanced, and had a nice kick at the end.  
After our first night, we decided to go back during lunch in hopes of seeing our beloved bartender there...he was not and the cocktails just didn't seem the same after.  But, I will say their small plates menu is decent.  The potatoes with garlic aioli had a crunchy exterior and soft interior.  Just the way potatoes should be made.  Cheese plate is good too, wish it came with toasted bread.
Later that day same day, we returned in the evening because I knew Marco would be there!  I told him to make me a Chinese New Year drink inspired by the Year of the Rooster, and it had to be red or gold in color.  Since they didn't have rooster sauce (sriracha), he used Tabasco.  I'm really not a huge fan of Tabasco to begin with so I was thinking the hype of Marco would die down... Nope!  He, again, exceeded my expectation & mind was blown.

If it wasn't for him, I would probably give the establishment a 3 but because of his professionalism, liquor knowledge, and great service, it's a 5'er.
