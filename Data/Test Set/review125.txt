we wanted to drive in the city for a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> italian </adj> dinner date, my husband and <adj> i </adj>. and <adj> i </adj> came across this spot, <adj> i </adj>'m a <adj> picky </adj> eater so <adj> i </adj> chose this out of a <adj> few </adj> <adj> other </adj> options. 

what won me over was the fact they have <adj> happy </adj> hour all day! only on the food list, not the "<adj> featured </adj> dishes." 

we walked in, the ambience looked so lovely, intimate, and sweet. it's <adj> perfect </adj> for date night or a <adj> nice </adj> night out with friends. the people knew i was deaf because i obviously was signing, the bartender was so <adj> attentive </adj> and <adj> nice </adj>. 
the waiter was so <adj> sweet </adj>! <adj> i </adj> loved her style, too <adj> bad </adj> <adj> i </adj> never got her name. the staff was so <adj> nice </adj>, we sat at the bar for a bit and when one of the tables cleared up, they sat us down at the table immediately. they even carried our drinks over! <adj> great </adj> staff. 


we ordered four <adj> different </adj> dishes, like the <adj> grilled </adj> octopus salad with <adj> citrus </adj> emulsion. 
<adj> i </adj> have to say, that was the <adj> best </adj> octopus <adj> i </adj>'ve ever had. <adj> i </adj>'m a fan of octopus and this was cooked perfectly! it was <adj> great </adj> to share with my husband too, you will not regret this order. 

<adj> top </adj> sirloin <adj> steak </adj> with <adj> feta </adj> riccola salad, that was so <adj> good </adj>. i loved loved this. i only <adj> wish </adj> they had more <adj> steak </adj> but that's <adj> okay </adj>, it was seriously the bomb dotcom. the <adj> feta </adj> cheese was amazing too, the salad... yum. 

my husband ordered the gnocchi rose and he loved it. i'm not a fan of gnocchi in <adj> general </adj>, but the taste was <adj> delicious </adj>. 

he also ordered the mussels with bread, the broth was amazing. the waiter even came back and asked us if we wanted <adj> complimentary </adj> bread to dip the broth in. i was like <adj> yes </adj> please. <adj> needless </adj> to say, we definitely swallowed up every bit of our four meals. 

come for <adj> happy </adj> hour! the trip from bothell was so <adj> worth </adj> it. 

<adj> next </adj> time <adj> i </adj>'m visiting <adj> seattle </adj>, <adj> i </adj>'ll definitely come back here and <adj> i </adj> highly recommend this to anyone who is visiting from out of town or even any <adj> seattle </adj> <adj> local </adj>!
