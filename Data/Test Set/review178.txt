barley swine positively surprised me, which is <adj> hard </adj> to do when you go to a restaurant expecting to be completely blown away. something <adj> i </adj> love about barley- the feeling is <adj> intimate </adj> but <adj> relaxed </adj>. though it's a very <adj> nice </adj> restaurant you are being served by people who are dressed casually with tattoos or whatever else makes them <adj> unique </adj>, and they know the dishes by heart. it's just more <adj> chill </adj> and <adj> comfortable </adj> than any <adj> other </adj> restaurant <adj> i </adj>'ve been to. 

i made reservations in advance for the chef's tasting menu for two. we only ate fish and they said that wouldn't be a problem... so <adj> good </adj>! there were 11 dishes, and they were all <adj> tasty </adj>, but some stood out <adj> big </adj> time. 

<adj> shrimp </adj> dumplings with <adj> hot </adj> sauce- especially <adj> interesting </adj> because you're expecting dumplings with <adj> shrimp </adj> in them. <adj> wrong </adj>! you get dumplings that have been made out of <adj> shrimp </adj>. <adj> creative </adj>, <adj> different </adj>, <adj> unique </adj>, and all those <adj> other </adj> worlds, plus <adj> delicious </adj>. 

the <adj> shiitake </adj> pasta with <adj> scrambled </adj> egg and grilled broccoli was also <adj> special </adj>. the pasta was filled with a very <adj> strong </adj> and deliciously cooked <adj> shiitake </adj> mushroom concoction. <adj> wonderful </adj> flavor and texture. 

and my <adj> absolute </adj> favorite- the <adj> poached </adj> <adj> red </adj> snapper. that <adj> fish </adj> melted in my mouth and was swimming in the most <adj> delicate </adj> <adj> delicious </adj> sauce. the portion is <adj> small </adj> but the flavors are so <adj> special </adj> that you want to take <adj> small </adj> bites to enjoy every <adj> single </adj> <adj> little </adj> bit. and a <adj> larger </adj> portion would be too <adj> rich </adj>! it was <adj> perfect </adj>. 

the <adj> blackened </adj> octopus was also particularly <adj> amazing </adj>. i had never had octopus that reminded me of chicken, but in a very <adj> good </adj> way. it was so <adj> smoky </adj> but tender and meaty all at the <adj> same </adj> time. that one was also a <adj> big </adj> winner. 

not only is it very <adj> difficult </adj> to prefect <adj> such </adj> <adj> small </adj>, <adj> amazing </adj> dishes, but having <adj> top </adj> notch service is also very <adj> difficult </adj>. just think, we had at <adj> least </adj> 11 dishes and every dish we were given <adj> fresh </adj> silverware and often more water. it was perfectly timed and executed. we don't usually treat ourselves to 11 course dinners but we decided that this would definitely be a place we'd come more often. chef's tasting menu- <adj> greatest </adj> idea ever.
