It's called Simple for a reason. 

I ordered the Salmon Pokbowl with all the crunches ($9.50). Last time I was at Pokworks, I deeply regretted not asking for more crisps, so I paid an extra $0.50 for more wonton crisps and they loaded my bowl with just that, so I was happy with that. However, right as I dug in and even took a couple of bites, I noticed a very small piece of hair laying on my salmon. Ahhh, yes nothing like fresh salmon with a piece of human DNA at a poke spot that supposedly had an A for hygiene. 

Disgusted, I immediately took a picture of this (of course), but after that, I took the bowl to the counter to make note of this. The owner (I'm pretty sure because she was ordering others what to do) rudely asked "Where?" when I told her there was a piece of hair in my bowl. She had to take a closer look before believing me and she turned around and muttered something to the person preparing the bowls. Then she turned to me and said "We'll make another bowl for you." Not a single apology. Clearly there was something wrong with her attitude and her morale of how to run a business.

I have to admit, I was put into a bad mood because of the customer service, but I gave the second bowl a second chance. It indeed did fill me up, but mainly because it was overloaded with carbs, and not so much of the toppings. The salmon wasn't very well marinated either. All in all, I've had better pokebowls for better quality and for the same price, not to mention better customer service.
