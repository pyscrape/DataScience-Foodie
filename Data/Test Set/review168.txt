we came here with a party of 8 adults. barley swine has a <adj> great </adj> selection of a la carte dishes or the chef's tasting menu ($90). not everyone in our party was <adj> interested </adj> in the chef's tasting menu. for timing purposes-- either everyone in the party orders the tasting menu or everyone orders a la carte. 

our group is very close with one another so we opted to do a la carte with a twist! we ordered one of everything on the menu and shared it among the <adj> entire </adj> party. once we had tried everything we were all <adj> able </adj> to order the dishes we wanted, individually. that way we were all <adj> able </adj> to try the <adj> full </adj> menu but no one was obligated to order the tasting menu. it was a <adj> happy </adj> compromise for the <adj> entire </adj> party. 

i'm <adj> glad </adj> we did it that way because i really wanted to do the tasting menu, so i was <adj> able </adj> to try a <adj> little </adj> bit of everything and then was <adj> able </adj> to order the dishes i loved the most. our waiter probably hated us, but we had a <adj> great </adj> experience. the food was <adj> phenomenal </adj>! i highly recommend.
