i stopped by for <adj> swine </adj> time this <adj> past </adj> week and found the barley <adj> swine </adj> that i had always hoped was there.  the food was <adj> full </adj> of <adj> great </adj> <adj> fresh </adj> flavors in <adj> beautiful </adj> presentations, but in <adj> small </adj> plates that were completely <adj> accessible </adj> to my pallet.

we arrived at 5:20 pm on a wednesday and were <adj> able </adj> to sit at the bar.  <adj> lucky </adj> us, one of our <adj> favorite </adj> bartenders, casey, who we know from <adj> many </adj> <adj> great </adj> lunches at the bar at <adj> odd </adj> duck has moved up <adj> north </adj> to barley swine and greeted us with a <adj> great </adj> <adj> big </adj> smile.  robert, the bar manager, was also on hand and made a point to check in and make us feel <adj> welcome </adj>.

we really really <adj> liked </adj> everything we had.  

of everything the <adj> smoked </adj> <adj> fish </adj> salad was the most bland.  but <adj> i </adj> got some <adj> delicious </adj> flavors at the end when <adj> i </adj> was <adj> able </adj> to incorporate the <adj> lime-dressed </adj> micro-greens with the <adj> avocado </adj> and <adj> fish </adj> salad.  this was a reminder that the key to eating here it to try to taste all components of a <adj> dish </adj> together in each bite.  what <adj> i </adj> loved about the <adj> fish </adj> salad was the presentation of the <adj> rich </adj> green, finely sliced <adj> avocado </adj> exquisitely molded over the quenelle of <adj> fish </adj> salad.
 
the zucchini with apple and goat feta also had a <adj> beautiful </adj> presentation in the shape of a flower.  in this case the server was <adj> sure </adj> to instruct us that although very pretty, the flower was meant to be destroyed as we incorporated all ingredients of the dish together to eat.

oyster mushrooms with rapini and steak sauce were <adj> rich </adj> and filling.  

nothing about the description of the shitake pasta prepared us for this dish.  the pasta was formed into <adj> rectangular </adj> capsules filled with broth and sealed.  it was an <adj> incredible </adj> sensation to bite into the <adj> al </adj> dente <adj> fresh </adj> pasta and be greeted with a flood of <adj> rich </adj> broth.

the masa pancakes with apache blue and <adj> hot </adj> sauce were <adj> hearty </adj> comfort food.  <adj> due </adj> to a food allergy in our party, we asked for the <adj> hot </adj> sauce on the side, so my photo here does not represent the <adj> usual </adj> presentation of this dish.

we finished our dining experience with the chocolate ice cream sandwich with mint, milk jam and <adj> pecan </adj>.  what the menu left off the description was the <adj> crunchy </adj> honey nougat that was crushed and crumbled over the dessert.  so <adj> yummy </adj>!

menus here rotate with the season, so what we had might not be <adj> available </adj> when you come.  however, <adj> i </adj> have faith in owner / chef bryce gilmore and his team that they will continue to create <adj> amazing </adj> dishes, as <adj> i </adj> had on my most <adj> recent </adj> visit; and <adj> i </adj>'m <adj> eager </adj> to try whatever they have on the menu the <adj> next </adj> time <adj> i </adj> visit.
