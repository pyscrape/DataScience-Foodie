Brand new to the Austin food truck scene, Dee Dee offers a selection of North Thai street food that's truly authentic and possibly addictive.  Tucked in the back of the same lot as la Barbecue, owners Justin and Lakana are selling some seriously tasty home cooking.  I decided to try all three of their savory offerings and came away impressed.  

Their pork skewers (Moo Ping) were amazing, marinated to perfection and freshly grilled.  While there was enough flavor just in the meat itself, it came with a small container of spicy fish sauce for dipping.  Loved their fish sauce as it was also a great accompaniment to the side of sticky rice.

The Larb Moo and Pad Kra Pow were also equally delicious and both featured  more well seasoned pork.  The first is served with sticky rice while the latter comes with jasmine rice and fried egg.  I can assure you both were devoured in record time... just too good not to be.

Do yourself a favor the next time you're in the area and skip the BBQ line to give Dee Dee a try.  You'll be glad you did.
