Amazing "late" graduation dinner. I had prawns, crab, filet mignon and "cake" All were amazing. Amazing and very accommodating service. Macaroons were to die for. They also gave us chocolate and adorable matchboxes. I've never been so full in my life. An amazing dinner with amazing food. I hope to come back!
