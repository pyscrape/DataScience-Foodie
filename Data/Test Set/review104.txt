This is a great bar around Times Square area. Trendy and very nicely decorated classic interiors with high tables + seats. I went in for a drink after dinner - couldn't try the appetizers but would love to taste some in the near future!

We ordered two cocktails - Willy Wonka and Kinky Boots! (love the names - perfect for the location!)
Willy Wonka - Just as the name may imply, this magical drink is full of sweet chocolate flavors and toasted Marshmallows on top. Really loved the taste. (Not too sweet)
Kinky Boots - This Fruity Cocktail is kinking with citrus flavor.
