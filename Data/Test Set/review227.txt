A new favorite go-to spot in WG. We've gotten take out twice and sat down once, and each time has involved their super delicious and filling Ravioli di Pere. The restaurant is quaint and dark, and service was great. We've also tried the Burrata, Farfalle Ai Crostacei, Agnolotti Di Zucca all of which were very good as well - expect to leave full!
