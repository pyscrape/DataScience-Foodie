i really wanted to like this place. excuse my french has a <adj> great </adj> ambiance, but the food just wasn't <adj> good </adj>.

my group of three had 5 dishes:
1. scallops: the <adj> raw </adj> scallops tasted very <adj> fresh </adj>, but i think the roe gave the dish a <adj> bitter </adj> aftertaste that wasn't very <adj> pleasant </adj>. the pomegranate seeds helped a <adj> little </adj> bit with the bitterness, but definitely this is not a dish i'd be <adj> interested </adj> in trying again

2. <adj> steak </adj> tartare slightly seared: we got two plates of this because my friend who's been here before said this was very <adj> good </adj>, and <adj> i </adj> generally adore <adj> steak </adj> tartare. however, no <adj> more </adj> <adj> quail </adj> eggs on the <adj> steak </adj> tartare, which really <adj> disappointed </adj> my friend because that was one of her <adj> favorite </adj> parts. <adj> i </adj> think it would have also been better without the searing, and the <adj> added </adj> sprouts on top didn't add anything to the dish... <adj> i </adj> liked the <adj> steak </adj> tartare <adj> enough </adj>, but it wasn't as <adj> interesting </adj> as <adj> i </adj>'d hoped based on <adj> previous </adj> reviewers.

3. <adj> foie </adj> gras pops: my husband liked this but i wasn't a fan. the <adj> foie </adj> gras in <adj> such </adj> <adj> large </adj> chunks was a bit too <adj> rich </adj> and felt like eating pure fat with the <adj> soft </adj> liver texture that comes with <adj> foie </adj> gras. i believe <adj> foie </adj> gras should be spread on bread and not eaten in <adj> large </adj> chunks by itself. otherwise, it's just too <adj> much </adj>.

4. <adj> duck </adj> confit: my <adj> least </adj> <adj> favorite </adj> dish. this one was actually <adj> terrible </adj>. the <adj> soft </adj> potatoe texture does not work with the <adj> duck </adj> meat in the middle. you also end up with <adj> large </adj> bites of potato. also, the  truffle smell was very <adj> overpowering </adj> and made the <adj> duck </adj> barely <adj> existent </adj> as part of the dish. i felt like i was eating a potato mash with a <adj> unknown </adj> meat that had a <adj> strong </adj> truffle smell (which is <adj> stinky </adj> because truffles are <adj> stinky </adj> even though <adj> delicious </adj>)

5. <adj> salmon </adj> butterfly: probably the <adj> best </adj> dish we had. the <adj> salmon </adj> was <adj> delicious </adj> and worked well with the ratatouille. unfortunately, this dish doesn't work well with the <adj> other </adj> tapas... the tomato and <adj> pepper </adj> flavor doesn't work with the scallops, steak tartare, duck confit, and <adj> foie </adj> gras. i think this should just be made into an <adj> entree </adj> that can be eaten by itself.

drinks here are <adj> great </adj>. we each got something <adj> different </adj>. i don't think you can go <adj> wrong </adj> on picking a drink as long as you know which <adj> main </adj> spirit you like.

i wouldn't come here for the food. just the drinks and ambiance. would be a <adj> great </adj> after dinner place to hang out, though majority of the space is taken up by the bar. it gets pretty <adj> busy </adj> later in the night.
