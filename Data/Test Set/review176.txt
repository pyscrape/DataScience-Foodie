How to be treated special on your birthday: Go to Barley. Practically every person working came over to wish me happy birthday and that means a lot to me. 

Old location vs. new location differences? Well other than the building and the new street, you can still expect to receive the best service and the best food in town. It has always been such a treat dining here, seriously the service could not be better. It is still true that each person who works here genuinely appears to enjoy working here and it shows. The new building is beautiful inside and out and they've got a bit more space to work with now. 

And yes if you're wondering, Barley is meat-free friendly! Just let them know a few days in advance when you make your reservation and they will happily accommodate and accept the challenge! We feasted for almost 3 hours on delicious meatless food from the Chef's Tasting Menu. The alcohol pairing was a nice addition to the experience and it really was a lot of alcohol to be honest. Make sure you have a DD and also expect to get tipsy enough to pass out fully clothed once you stumble into bed. Birthday=successful. I could go on and on about how great the food is, but you already know that to be factual. I'm so glad to have such a great innovative restaurant break up with the south and emerge victorious on the north side.
