<adj> i </adj> try to visit restaurants bon <adj> appetit </adj> names in its <adj> top </adj> 50 list each year, and so <adj> i </adj> had to visit emmer & rye while <adj> i </adj> was in town for work. it was a <adj> perfect </adj> choice for me and 3 friends, and the bill was still <adj> reasonable </adj> at around $60 each for two cocktails each and plenty of food. 

before visiting emmer & rye, it's <adj> important </adj> to understand a <adj> few </adj> things:
a) it's a tapas restaurant, and you will be given the choice to order by menu or off the "<adj> dim </adj> sum" cart. we did not find <adj> many </adj> items that enticed us on the carts the evening of our visit -- they all seemed <adj> small </adj> and pricey for the size. there also just wasn't anything that really caught our attention, <adj> creative </adj> as it was. we did love the <adj> vegetarian </adj> gorditas of all the choices. <adj> i </adj> encourage the owners to visit state bird provisions in <adj> san </adj> francisco to see how to do the <adj> dim </adj> sum option with <adj> substantial </adj> portions.
b) yes, there is a cart that's going to wheel by with a food introduction on each cart, so don't come to emmer for a <adj> serious </adj> conversation or a <adj> first </adj> date. even in my case, i was trying to catch up with some friends i haven't seen in a while, and the <adj> constant </adj> people stopping by was a bit distracting. 
c) <adj> i </adj> just moved from brooklyn and <adj> i </adj> live in the <adj> san </adj> francisco bay area, so no one appreciates farm to table, <adj> local </adj>, <adj> organic </adj> and <adj> creative </adj> <adj> more </adj> than me. in these places, that's just how food is done, and it's expected. <adj> i </adj> do find it sometimes a bit annoying when <adj> i </adj> go to <adj> other </adj> cities that feel that they have to educate you on the food. this is a <adj> fine </adj> line here. <adj> i </adj> do like a <adj> nice </adj> description, but <adj> i </adj> found that explaining the menu, the approach, and every item every time that showed up just got a bit <adj> tiresome </adj> here as if they needed to prove themselves or something. "this is our (<adj> insert </adj> thing you've never heard of before) grown at the <adj> local </adj> (<adj> insert </adj> farm name) fermented for 100 years in our curing room located here in house) and topped with (<adj> insert </adj> beet or cauliflower or kale)."  "this is our .... ." it would have made for a <adj> great </adj> food show segment -- as long as that is the goal of your experience.

with those three caveats, emmer & rye is an <adj> incredible </adj> food and dining experience - you should just go knowing those things. our <adj> table </adj> loved the cacio e pepe in <adj> particular </adj>, and we had to order two servings of it to satisfy our taste buds. the <adj> kale </adj> appetizer also was a <adj> table </adj> favorite. the <adj> old </adj> <adj> fashioned </adj> cocktail was <adj> delicious </adj>, though <adj> spare </adj> in its portion. 

there was a lot of <adj> creative </adj> food, <adj> friendly </adj> people and a warm atmosphere here. there just was nothing that <adj> i </adj> will crave or think about for days after -- and that seems to me to the work this restaurant needs to do to go from a 4 to a 5 in my estimation. <adj> i </adj> went once, but <adj> i </adj>'m not <adj> sure </adj> if something is really drawing me back. that's <adj> fixable </adj>, and there's a lot to be said for what is happening already.
