this is now my <<adj> adj </adj>> <<adj> adj </adj>> favorite </<adj> adj </adj>> </<adj> adj </adj>> poke <<adj> adj </adj>> joint </<adj> adj </adj>> in seattle. their fish is <<adj> adj </adj>> fresh </<adj> adj </adj>> from hawaii and it melts in your mouth, it's <<adj> adj </adj>> crazy </<adj> adj </adj>>. they have so <<adj> adj </adj>> many </<adj> adj </adj>> assortments of sauces for their fish and it's laid out <<adj> adj </adj>> chipotle </<adj> adj </adj>> style so you have a lot of room for customization. plus the interior is <<adj> adj </adj>> super cute </<adj> adj </adj>>. 
<adj> i </adj>'ve also tried their <adj> dole </adj> whip float (<adj> i </adj> think that's what it's called) and their mochi ice creams and both are really <adj> good </adj>! <adj> i </adj> personally love <adj> li </adj> hing powder (which is what they put on their floats, its kind of like a plum powder??) but <adj> i </adj> do think <adj> i </adj>'d prefer just the <adj> dole </adj> whip on its <adj> own </adj>.
can't wait to go back here!
