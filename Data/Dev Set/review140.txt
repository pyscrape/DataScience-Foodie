<adj> overall </adj>, <adj> solid </adj> <adj> american </adj> fair that's well executed, and the portions are <adj> sufficient </adj> to share among a party of 4. we appreciated the <adj> thoughtful </adj> staff who even cut our hamburger into 4 pieces when we divulged that we'd be sharing all of the entrees. 

roasted chicken salad - the <adj> baked </adj> chicken thigh was <adj> moist </adj> and <adj> seasoned </adj> with salt & pepper. the <adj> warm </adj> chicken was <adj> delicious </adj> with the <adj> fresh </adj> arugula greens that are lightly dressed in a cranberry vinaigrette. <adj> good </adj> proportion of <adj> candied </adj> pecans and beets along with two wedges of <adj> camembert </adj> cheese elevated the flavors and textures for a rather <adj> simple </adj> salad.

congress burger - moist beef with <adj> fresh </adj> lettuce and tomatoes to add some lightness to the dish. try to sub out the chips for fries.. the house made chips were <adj> fine </adj> but fries are always better!

pomodoro pizza - <adj> italian </adj> sausage - the crust here is <adj> unique </adj> and <adj> splendid </adj> - there's a bit of grittiness that comes through from the corn meal which has been incorporated into the dough. this adds even more pizzazz to the very <adj> thin </adj> and <adj> crisp </adj> crust. if you don't like the <adj> cracker-like </adj> crusts, then you won't be a fan of their style of pizza. i appreciated the heap of basil added to the top rather than the <adj> 3-4 </adj> <adj> whole </adj> <adj> small </adj> leaves that you might get for a <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> neapolitan </adj> pizza. the sausage was <adj> good </adj> - not too <adj> salty </adj> and had a bit of fennel flavoring.

as a "dessert", we shared the <adj> french </adj> toast - which is like no <adj> other </adj> <adj> french </adj> toast - the <adj> thick </adj> texas toast drenched in pecans, bananas and syrup made for a <adj> decadent </adj> finish to a very <adj> good </adj> meal. this <adj> dish </adj> almost tasted as if <adj> true </adj> banana bread was used to make the <adj> french </adj> toast but the bread was still <adj> light </adj> and not overly <adj> eggy </adj>.
