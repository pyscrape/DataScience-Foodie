we discovered <adj> second </adj> bar during a <adj> recent </adj> trip to austin and were surprised to find that the <adj> open-air </adj>, <adj> dog-friendly </adj> patio was relatively <adj> uninhabited </adj> on a <adj> sunny </adj> <adj> saturday </adj> afternoon. you can find plenty of <adj> free </adj> street parking nearby on weekends. our waitress was pretty <adj> quirky </adj>, but the service was smooth for the <adj> most </adj> part. they did forget to add bacon to my girlfriend's sandwich, but were <adj> apologetic </adj> and promptly brought us some on the side.

we ordered <adj> bloody </adj> marys to start, and <adj> i </adj> was <adj> impressed </adj> both by how they managed to be spicy without the <adj> usual </adj> bitterness and by how they were $7. a <adj> popular </adj> brunch place with cocktails for under $12? unheard of. <adj> i </adj> went with the <adj> black </adj> and <adj> bleu </adj> pizza, which was mind-numbingly <adj> good </adj> and highly <adj> recommended </adj> if you are a fan of bold, <adj> unusual </adj> flavors. the pungency of the cheese and <adj> red </adj> onions accentuated the contrast between the <adj> sugary </adj> dates and salty pork belly. unfortunately, my girlfriend found her sandwich (the breakfast club, with scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato) fairly plain, so <adj> i </adj> dropped the rating from a 5 to a 4. the <adj> black </adj> truffle grits were likewise bland, although <adj> i </adj> am a <adj> self-proclaimed </adj> grits hater...<adj> i </adj> don't get the appeal. my suggestion would be to go for some of their off-beat options rather than the <adj> run-of-the-mill </adj> brunch bites, since they seem to excel more in this arena.
