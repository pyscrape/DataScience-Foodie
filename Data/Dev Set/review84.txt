<adj> delicious </adj>. 

i stumbled upon this <adj> tiny </adj> spot that ended up serving me the <adj> best </adj> poke bowl i've had in the city. 

we tasted their <adj> salmon </adj> poke bowl and their ahi tuna poke bowl, and they were both <adj> phenomenal </adj> (and filling). <adj> fresh </adj> ingredients, mouthwatering fish, and plenty of <adj> tasty </adj> rice on the bottom (we opted for <adj> brown </adj> rice). 

the service is <adj> personable </adj> and welcoming. it's a <adj> tiny </adj> place, so not <adj> many </adj> seats. however, turnover is fast. 

truly highly <adj> recommended </adj>.
