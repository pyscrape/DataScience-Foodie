<adj> great </adj> spot, although a bit <adj> pricey </adj> since all of the <adj> small </adj> plates are really <adj> expensive </adj> given the <adj> small </adj> quantity of food.

we had the thai deviled eggs, <adj> eggplant </adj> chips, brisket sliders, pork tacos, and a <adj> whole </adj> bunch of cocktails.

i really enjoyed the <adj> smoked </adj> cocktail.

service was pretty <adj> efficient </adj>, and the place ended up getting pretty packed. <adj> i </adj> think you'd be okay if you wanted to eat here before a show.
