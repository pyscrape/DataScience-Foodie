pleasantly satisfied with our experience here, plus it was our <adj> first </adj> time at a <adj> polish </adj> restaurant! <adj> i </adj> highly recommend the plate of <adj> polish </adj> specialties with potatoe pancakes, pierogies of <adj> different </adj> flavors (potatoe, mushroom), hunter's stew, <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage, etc. it did not come with <adj> sour </adj> cream but <adj> i </adj> suggest you ask for it on the side (<adj> great </adj> with the potatoe pancakes and pierogies!

for appetizers, we ordered the blood sausage (<adj> generous </adj> portion size) and the <adj> white </adj> borscht soup (was my <adj> favorite </adj> part of the meal). the soup was supposed to come in a <adj> bread </adj> bowl but they ran out. the soup also came with the most <adj> creamy </adj>, <adj> yummy </adj>, mashed potatoes with <adj> chunky </adj> bacon bits!

order any beer because they are brewed to perfection and served in a <adj> large </adj> glass. suits well with the <adj> polish </adj> <adj> village-themed </adj> decorations, bartenders/waitresses in <adj> cultural </adj> dress and the savory, homey food. i also tried the honey wine which was an <adj> interesting </adj>, <adj> little </adj> bit <adj> sweet </adj> taste.

when we first arrived for dinner on a <adj> saturday </adj> night, it would take at <adj> least </adj> a one hour but it was definitely <adj> worth </adj> the wait! the waitresses are <adj> super </adj> friendly and the host was very <adj> professional </adj>, <adj> direct </adj> and organized. at the end, if you pay with card, they will ask for the tip written before they swipe the cards (but feel <adj> free </adj> to leave a cash tip)!
