<adj> i </adj>'m <adj> such </adj> a fan! there seems to be a <adj> recent </adj> surge of <adj> korean-inspired </adj> <adj> tapas-style </adj> restaurants. <adj> thursday </adj> kitchen does not disappoint. 

the tapas dishes <adj> overall </adj> are <adj> delicious </adj>, with <adj> good </adj> portions and <adj> reasonable </adj> prices. you can't go <adj> wrong </adj> with any of the menu items. couldn't say anything <adj> bad </adj> about any of the 8 dishes we ordered. definitely like to highlight the truffle mac & cheese, <adj> soft </adj> shell crab, and chicken though. i was also wow'ed by the <adj> matcha </adj> bread dessert. <adj> super </adj> <adj> delicious </adj>.

service was the <adj> best </adj> i've received in ages. despite their business, our cups of water were never empty. the staff was <adj> nice </adj> and <adj> attentive </adj>, and answered <adj> many </adj> questions for us.
