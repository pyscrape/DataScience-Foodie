i absolutely adore this place!

i first came here when it was relatively <adj> new </adj> and loved all the fusion dishes they offered here. i like to think that when restaurants offer "fusion <adj> asian </adj>" cuisine, it's because they actually took the time to develop a menu that contain dishes with <adj> different </adj> <adj> asian </adj> influences. offering both <adj> thai </adj> food and <adj> korean </adj> food does not make it an <adj> asian </adj> fusion restaurant! 

<adj> rant </adj> aside, i loved everything we ordered. they have a <adj> great </adj> selection, and i hope they don't make too <adj> many </adj> <adj> new </adj> changes! the caprisun pouchy <adj> alcoholic </adj> drinks were also <adj> fun </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>. we came during <adj> happy </adj> hour, so they were only 5 bucks! i also secretly really wanted to keep the glowing ice cube..
