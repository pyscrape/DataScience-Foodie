really <adj> neat </adj> place just right off of all the <adj> main </adj> broadway theaters.  not too crowded when we first sat down but <adj> i </adj> guess once work let out the place got <adj> pretty </adj> packed.  <adj> i </adj> ordered the smoking reverend for a drink which was a bourbon and <adj> wine </adj> reduction with just a hint of antica that made it a <adj> wonderful </adj> pairing with my <adj> lamb </adj> burger. <adj> i </adj> also had tried the buffalo chicken spring rolls which were very <adj> unique </adj> and seemed like a <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> cool </adj> idea, may try to make these for a party hehe. 
service was off the chart awesome, drinks came out quickly and the food not too long later. servers were also very <adj> attentive </adj> and made <adj> sure </adj> the <adj> whole </adj> dining experience was <adj> great </adj>.  i would definitely recommend coming here if not for the <adj> good </adj> food then for the drinks which were all show themed.
