i think there is <adj> enough </adj> said about this place. we stood in the line for about 45 mins in the rain to eat the <adj> best </adj> bowl of pasta outside italy. and we will do it again!
we ordered the bread, kale salad, the lasagne and the gigli. they customized an order for our 5 yr <adj> old </adj>. a bottle of wine. that says it all! in love!
