gopok, gopok, gopok!

with the <adj> recent </adj> influx of <adj> pok </adj> joints in the area, <adj> i </adj>'ve been on a mission to try them all. so far, <adj> gopok </adj> wins, thanks to their <adj> generously </adj> cut <adj> fish </adj>, quality, freshness, and marinated flavor.

boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch this afternoon, were <<adj> adj </adj>> warmly </<adj> adj </adj>> greeted, and given samples of every pok <adj> available </adj>. our favorites were the spicy tako, <adj> classic </adj> ahi, and the spicy aioli ahi. we <<adj> adj </adj>> absolutely </<adj> adj </adj>> loved the fact that everything was <adj> marinated </adj> well, and bursting with <adj> classic </adj> <adj> hawaiian </adj> pok flavors. the <adj> customizable </adj> joints ain't got <adj> nothin </adj>' on this place. throw all the sauces you want on your fish, but you just can't compete with <adj> marinated </adj> pok. 

at $11 for a <<adj> adj </adj>> regular </<adj> adj </adj>> (1 pok), $13 for a <<adj> adj </adj>> large </<adj> adj </adj>> (2 pok), and $18 for a <<adj> adj </adj>> king-size </<adj> adj </adj>> (more pok), bowls are slightly <<adj> adj </adj>> pricey </<adj> adj </adj>>, but worth it. we shared a <<adj> adj </adj>> king-size </<adj> adj </adj>> bowl, which was generously filled with rice, <<adj> adj </adj>> classic </<adj> adj </adj>> & spicy aioli ahi, edamame, krab salad, seaweed salad, masago, pickled ginger, and topped off with <<adj> adj </adj>> crispy </<adj> adj </adj>> shallots, garlic, and furikake. since it was a <<adj> adj </adj>> cold </<adj> adj </adj>> day, we were also given <<adj> adj </adj>> complimentary </<adj> adj </adj>> bowls of miso soup to warm us up, which was a <adj> nice </adj> touch.

family owned and operated, gopok is pretty <adj> much </adj> pok perfection up in the pnw.
