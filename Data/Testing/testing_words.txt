i've
ever
had.the
absolute
best
service
i've
ever
had
at
a
restaurant.
i
have
eaten
at
a
lot
of
nice
restaurants,
but
canlis
put
most
all
of
them
to
shame.
the
service
alone
makes
this
review
5
stars.the
second
best
view
from
any
seattle
restaurant
(the
best
being
atop
the
space
needle).after
having
the
full
course
menu
(which
was
spectacular
is
to
skip
the
full
wine
pairing
(which
we
each
also
had,
and
didn't
really
enjoy).
the
wine
pairings
were
almost
too
much
for
me,
and
were
way
too
much
for
my
wife.
if
you're
stuck
on
getting
the
wine
pairings
(and
you
really
like
both
red
and
white
wines),
i
strongly
suggest
considering
sharing
the
flight.
i
very
glad
we
took
an
uber
to
and
from.
the
amount
of
alcohol
we
consumed
tamped
down
a
bit
on
our
delight
of
the
food.seattle
has
so
many
wonderful
restaurants
with
some
of
the
best
food
i've
ever
had
anywhere,
but
canlis
distinguishes
itself
with
service,
class,
and
atmosphere.
i've
had
food
just
as
good
elsewhere
in
town,
but
nowhere
else
puts
it
all
together
like
this.canlis
also
distinguishes
itself
with
the
price.
this
was
our
20th
anniversary
dinner,
so
we
didn't
hold
back
at
all,
and
it
ended
up
being,
by
far,
and
i
mean
by
far,
the
single
most
expensive
dining
experience
the
two
of
us
have
ever
had.
canlis
should
have
6
of
those
$'s
that
yelp
uses.
that
said,
i
don't
regret
it
at
all.

i
love

if
you've
never

it

this
fish

i
ordered
a
salmon
poke
bowl
with
white
rice,
ocean
salad,
furikake,
and
pickled
ginger.
there
are
a
lot
of
topping
options
and
sides
on
the
menu,
but
i
like
to
keep
it
simple
the
salmon
was
well-marinated
i
tasted
soy,
sesame,
some
chilis,
sweet
onions,
but
i
could
still
taste
the
salmon
itself.
it
was
a
bit
on
the
salty
side
for
me,
but
the
rice
helps
to
neutralize
that.
the
portion
of
the
protein
was
smaller
than
i'm
used
to
at
my
usual
poke
spot,
but
i
like
the
flavors
of
the
salmon
marinade
here.
the
people
who
work
here
are
so
endearing
and
warm
.
they
made
my
friends
and
i
felt
looked
after
and
welcomed.
they
enbodied
that
aloha
spirit."btw,
they
have
spam
musubi
and
bubbies!!
i
should
have
ordered
those,
but
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
too

the

we
ended
up
getting

came

with
a
party
of
8
adults.
barley
swine
has
a
great
selection
of
a
la
carte
dishes
or
the
chef's
tasting
menu
($90).
not
everyone
in
our
party
was
interested
in
the
chef's
tasting
menu.
for
timing
purposes--
either
everyone
in
the
party
orders
the
tasting
menu
or
everyone
orders
a
la
carte.
our
group
is
very
close
with
one
another
so
we
opted
to
do
a
la
carte
with
a
twist!
we
ordered
one
of
everything
on
the
menu
and
shared
it
among
the
entire
party.
once
we
had
tried
everything
we
were
all
able
to
order
the
dishes
we
wanted,
individually.
that
way
we
were
all
able
to
try
the
full
menu
but
no
one
was
obligated
to
order
the
tasting
menu.
it
was
a
happy
compromise
for
the
entire
party.
i'm
glad
we
did
it
that
way
because
i
really
wanted
to
do
the
tasting
menu,
so
i
was
able
to
try
a
little
bit
of
everything
and
then
was
able
to
order
the
dishes
i
loved
the
most.
our
waiter
probably
hated
us,
but
we
had
a
great
experience.
the
food
was
phenomenal
i
highly
recommend.

friends
took
me
here
during
my
first
night
in
seattle
&
advised
how
amazing
the
bar
is.
they
said,
"tell
marco
what
you
like
and
he'll
make
you
something
delicious
at
first
you
might
think
they're
exaggerating
until
you
actually
order
with
him.while
my
request
was
fairly
easy
during
my
first
visit-
"jameson
mule
but
not
quite
a
mule".
he
killed
it
in
the
best
way
possible
my
friend's
request
was
a
little
more
complicated-
"vodka
or
rum
based,
little
spicy,
not
too
sweet
and
has
to
be
balanced".
he
did
just
that!
the
spicy
drink
was
smooth
balanced,
and
had
a
nice
kick
at
the
end.
after
our
first
night,
we
decided
to
go
back
during
lunch
in
hopes
of
seeing
our
beloved
bartender
there...he
was
not
and
the
cocktails
just
didn't
seem
the
same
after.
but,
i
will
say
their
small
plates
menu
is
decent
the
potatoes
with
garlic
aioli
had
a
crunchy
exterior
and
soft
interior.
just
the
way
potatoes
should
be
made.
cheese
plate
is
good
too,
wish
it
came
with
toasted
bread.later
that
day
same
day,
we
returned
in
the
evening
because
i
knew
marco
would
be
there!
i
told
him
to
make
me
a
chinese
new
year
drink
inspired
by
the
year
of
the
rooster,
and
it
had
to
be
red
or
gold
in
color.
since
they
didn't
have
rooster
sauce
(sriracha),
he
used
tabasco.
i
really
not
a
huge
fan
of
tabasco
to
begin
with
so
i
was
thinking
the
hype
of
marco
would
die
down...
nope!
he,
again,
exceeded
my
expectation
&
mind
was
blown.if
it
wasn't
for
him,
i
would
probably
give
the
establishment
a
3
but
because
of
his
professionalism,
liquor
knowledge,
and
great
service,
it's
a
5'er.

the

was

what
really

my

was
the
logistical

with
which
the
staff
made
sure
that
we
were
always
taken

and

throughout
the

spent

runs
with

restaurant
is
easy
to
find,
right
on
aurora
avenue
just
south
of
the
lake

bridge
and
well
marked.
we
pulled
up
to
the
front
door
and
valets
rushed
out
to
grab
my
car.
no
ticket
needed:
they
remember
you
based
on
the
name
on
your
reservation.
canlis
has
a
dress
code
and
you'll
want
to
go
more
formal
with
your
attire
here:
if
you're
going
by
traditional
dress
code
etiquette,
use
the
dressy
casual
code
at
a
minimum
(i.e.,
jackets
and
dress
shirt
for
men,
dresses,
skirts,
or
dressy
pants
outfits
for
women),
or
go
more
formal
if
you
wish.
i
saw
attire
ranging
from
dressy
casual
to
black
tie.a
host
immediately
greeted
us
as
we
walked
in
the
front
door
and
gave
our
names.
we
were
seated
immediately,
near
the
large
plate
glass
wraparound
windows
and
with
a
spectacular
sparkling
view
to
the
east
of
lake
union
and
capitol
hill.
our
server,
summer,
came
to
greet
us
within
one
minute
and
she
was
great
the
whole
meal.
she
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
made
sure
our
water
glasses
were
never
more
than
half
empty
our
drinks
always
full
and
food
always
either
in
front
of
us
or
on
the
way.
she
was
expert
on
the
nitty
gritty
details
of
all
the
cocktails,
wines,
and
food
options
that
we
asked
about,
had
well-reasoned
recommendations,
and
was
friendly
and
professional
a
glass
of
syrah
in
hand,
i
went
for
the
four-course
option.
it's
really
more
like
a
7-course
meal,
as
in
between
each
of
the
courses
they
bring
you
a
little
side
dish
to
nibble
on.
with
so
much
food
to
try,
i
won't
rehash
it
all
here,
but
i
will
say
that
it
was
all
delicious
perfectly
cooked,
and
well-worth
the
price.
my
favorite
highlights
of
the
meal
included
a
fried
buratta
appetizer,
cabbage
pierre,
wagyu
new
york
strip
steak,
and
an
in-between-courses
loaf
of
freshly
baked
saltwater
sourdough
bread.as
a
nifty
little
going-away
present,
the
valets
already
had
my
car
idling
and
ready
by
the
front
door
when
we
walked
out.
a
great
end
to
a
great
evening.

wanted
to
drive
in
the
city
for
a
nice
italian
dinner
date,
my
husband
and
i
and
i
came
across
this
spot,
i
a
picky
eater
so
i
chose
this
out
of
a
few
other
options.
what
won
me
over
was
the
fact
they
have
happy
hour
all
day!
only
on
the
food
list,
not
the
featured
dishes."
we
walked
in,
the
ambience
looked
so
lovely,
intimate,
and
sweet.
it's
perfect
for
date
night
or
a
nice
night
out
with
friends.
the
people
knew
i
was
deaf
because
i
obviously
was
signing,
the
bartender
was
so
attentive
and
nice
the
waiter
was
so
sweet
i
loved
her
style,
too
bad
i
never
got
her
name.
the
staff
was
so
nice
we
sat
at
the
bar
for
a
bit
and
when
one
of
the
tables
cleared
up,
they
sat
us
down
at
the
table
immediately.
they
even
carried
our
drinks
over!
great
staff.
we
ordered
four
different
dishes,
like
the
grilled
octopus
salad
with
citrus
emulsion.
i
have
to
say,
that
was
the
best
octopus
i
ever
had.
i
a
fan
of
octopus
and
this
was
cooked
perfectly!
it
was
great
to
share
with
my
husband
too,
you
will
not
regret
this
order.
top
sirloin

with

that
was
so
good
i
loved
loved
this.
i
only
wish
they
had
more
steak
but
that's
okay
it
was
seriously
the
bomb
dotcom.
the
feta
cheese
was
amazing
too,
the
salad...
yum.
my
husband
ordered
the
gnocchi
rose
and
he
loved
it.
i'm
not
a
fan
of
gnocchi
in
general
but
the
taste
was
delicious
he
also
ordered
the
mussels
with
bread,
the
broth
was
amazing.
the
waiter
even
came
back
and
asked
us
if
we
wanted
complimentary
bread
to
dip
the
broth
in.
i
was
like
yes
please.
needless
to
say,
we
definitely
swallowed
up
every
bit
of
our
four
meals.
come
for
happy
hour!
the
trip
from
bothell
was
so
worth
it.
next
time
i
visiting
seattle
i
definitely
come
back
here
and
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
visiting
from
out

even
any

on

my

ordered
a

start,
the
avocado

($12)
and
the

with
truffle
fries
($14
-
$4
for
the
truffle
fries).
the
truffle
fries
were
pretty
good
crispy
on
the
outside
and
had
a
nice
truffle
flavor.
the
avocado
fundido
was
something
different
house
chorizo
in
a
mini
skillet
with
avocado
and
queso

melted
on
top,
along
with
chipotle

usually
i
like
everything
pretty
seasoned
but
i
thought
the
chips
had
a
bit
too
much
seasoning
on
them
(it
became
pretty
salty
on
some
chips).
but
overall
this
was
a
solid
spot
to
eat
and
i
had
leftovers
which
eventually
went
to
waste
in
the
hot
heat
:(.
if
this
was
in

i
would

ll
corvo
pasta
is
a
very
small
and
i
mean
very
small
italian
restaurant
in
downtown
seattle.
it
is
located
on
a
slope
with
a
view
of
the
water.
i
not
sure
if
this
was
always
the
case,
but
you
are
going
to
be
waiting
a
long
time
for
a
meal
at
ll
corvo.
the
restaurant
is
only
open
for
lunch
and
rightfully
so
because
ll
be
booked
all
day
if
they
were
open
longer
i'm
pretty
sure
the
ultimate
appeal
about
this
restaurant
is
that
it
sells
high
quality
pasta
at
smaller
lunch
sized
portions
for
$9.
yes,
that's
right
good
pasta
for
nine
dollars.
since
this
place
opens
at
11,
this
means
come
at
11am
and
not
at
noon.
otherwise
you
won't
get
in
for
more
than
an
hour
and
you'll
be
waiting
on
that
fun
slope.when
you
do
get
in
you
will
notice
that
the
menu
is
very
simplistic
there
are
generally
only
3
pasta
items
that
rotate
as
well
as
usual
appetizers
such
as
a
kale
salad,
focaccia
bread,
and
a
number
of
sparkling
drinks.
i
ended
up
getting
a
pasta
which
i
unfortunately
forgot
the
name
of..
it
was
matisa
milk
with
feta..."
it
had
no
meat
in
it
but
it
seemed
like
a
popular
choice
and
so
i
got
it
with
focaccia
bread.
at
this
restaurant
you
don't
get
a
number,
you
just
wait
in
line,
order,
and

good
for
the

you
do
get
a

of

the

definitely
overweighs
the

i
was

visited

during

and
had
high
expectations
for
the
restaurant's
home-made

we
left
disappointed
but
were
still
glad
we
had
given
the
place
a
shot.the
pasta
menu
here
changes
from
day
to
day.
we
ordered:-
papparadelle
with
ragu

baked
lasagna
with
sun
gold
tomatoes,
summer
squash,
and
toasted
almond-
giardiniera
seasonal
overall
we
thought
the
pasta
here
was
way
too
thick
-
some
people
prefer
thick
pasta
but
we
were
looking
forward
to
thinner,
more
elastic
pasta
the
lasagna
in
particular
was
so
thick
that
it
was
actually
a
bit
hard
to
cut
through,
and
the
papparadelle
was
so
thick
and
dry
that
it
didn't
really
hang
on
to
any
of
the
sauce.
the
seasonal
pickles
were
alright
but
we
would
probably
recommend
skipping
them
considering
how
heavy
the
pasta
dishes
were.

i

there

we

was

excuse
my
french
has

ambiance,
but
the
food
just
wasn't
good
group
of
three
had
5
dishes:1.
scallops:
the
raw
scallops
tasted
very
fresh
but
i
think
the
roe
gave
the
dish
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
wasn't
very
pleasant
the
pomegranate
seeds
helped
a
little
bit
with
the
bitterness,
but
definitely
this
is
not
a
dish
i'd
be
interested
in
trying
again2.
steak
tartare
slightly
seared:
we
got
two
plates
of
this
because
my
friend
who's
been
here
before
said
this
was
very
good
and
i
generally
adore
steak
tartare.
however,
no
more
quail
eggs
on
the
steak
tartare,
which
really
disappointed
my
friend
because
that
was
one
of
her
favorite
parts.
i
think
it
would
have
also
been
better
without
the
searing,
and
the
added
sprouts
on
top
didn't
add
anything
to
the
dish...
i
liked
the
steak
tartare
enough
but
it
wasn't
as
interesting
as
i
hoped
based
on
previous
reviewers.3.
foie
gras
pops:
my
husband
liked
this
but
i
wasn't
a
fan.
the
foie
gras
in
such
large
chunks
was
a
bit
too
rich
and
felt
like
eating
pure
fat
with
the
soft
liver
texture
that
comes
with
foie
gras.
i
believe
foie
gras
should
be
spread
on
bread
and
not
eaten
in
large
chunks
by
itself.
otherwise,
it's
just
too
much
duck
confit:
my
least
favorite
dish.
this
one
was
actually
terrible
the
soft
potatoe
texture
does
not
work
with
the
duck
meat
in
the
middle.
you
also
end
up
with
large
bites
of
potato.
also,
the
truffle
smell
was
very
overpowering
and
made
the
duck
barely
existent
as
part
of
the
dish.
i
felt
like
i
was
eating
a
potato
mash
with
a
unknown
meat
that
had
a
strong
truffle
smell
(which
is
stinky
because
truffles
are
stinky
even
though
delicious
salmon
butterfly:
probably
the
best
dish
we
had.
the
salmon
was
delicious
and
worked
well
with
the
ratatouille.
unfortunately,
this
dish
doesn't
work
well
with
the
other
tapas...
the
tomato
and
pepper
flavor
doesn't
work
with
the
scallops,
steak
tartare,
duck
confit,
and
foie
gras.
i
think
this
should
just
be
made
into
an
entree
that
can
be
eaten
by
itself.drinks
here
are
great
we
each
got
something
different
i
don't
think
you
can
go
wrong
on
picking
a
drink

as
you
know
which

catching
a
show,
and
loved
it.
maybe
it
was
the
theatre
wine,
but
i
thought
the
food
was
delicious
and
the
bartender
was
a
saint
for
putting
up
with
our
slightly
tipsy
antics.
we

we
parked
in
a
neighborhood
around
the
corner
since
this
is
on
a
busy
street-
just
check
signs
and
you
should
be
good
we
went
early
so
there
was
no
one
else
around
eating
yet,
but
the
gentleman
(owner?)
at
the
window
walked
us
through
the
menu.
i
mentioned
my
aversion
to
things
to
spicy
and
he
gave
me
great
suggestions
and
even
asked
his
wife
i

the
one

to
use
less
spice
in
my
dish
so
i
could
enjoy
it.
my
husband
and
i
ordered
the
papaya
salad
and
the
pad
ka
pow
and
we
were
really
impressed.
they
were
both
so
delicious-
the
papaya
salad
was
so
fresh
and
light
on
a
brutally
hot
day,
and
the
pad
ka
pow
was
a
serious
kick
of
heat
(when
we
added
the
extra
hot
sauce.)
we
wanted
to
try
the
mango
rice
but
they
said
they
weren't
able
to
get
good
mango
that
day,
but
we're
looking
forward
to
trying
it
next
time.i
was
so
happy
they
had
la
croix
as
a
beverage
option,
not
just
soda
or

frustrating
this
review
is
based
solely
on
service
and
not
the
food
(we
didn't
get
to
eat).seeing
all
of
the
good
reviews
and
that
it
is
consistently
busy
each
time
i
walk
by,
i
made
a
reservation
for
the
bf
and
i
to
check
this
place
out
last
night.
we
walked
in
and
were
quickly
shown
to
our
table.
water
and
bread
were
served
to
us,
also
quickly.
this
is
where
service
ends
for
us...we
looked
over
the
menu,
discussed
what
we
wanted
to
order,
and
looked
over
the
wine
list...
for
15
minutes.
meanwhile,
the
place
is
bustling
-
servers
attending
to
their
tables,
people
bringing
out
food
and
drinks
-
normal
except,
no
one
attending
to
our
table.
we
looked
around,
trying
to
get
people's
attention
but,
alas,
nothing.
we
decided
to
give
it
another
5
minutes
even
though,
at
this
point,
we
are
truly
irritated
(and
hungry!).finally,
a
server
(chris)
comes
to
our
table
and
asks
if
anyone
has
helped
us.
we
explain
we
have
been
sitting
for
15
minutes
and
no
one
has
approached
us.
he
apologizes
and
explains
that
this
isn't
his
table
but,
he'd
be
happy
to
help
us
and
offers
us
glasses
of
prosecco,
which
we
politely
decline.we
start
by
asking
about
wine
and
he
brings
us
one
to
taste.
we
don't
like
it
and
i
ask
about
the
italian
wines.
he
confesses
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
italian
wines
odd
since
he
works
in
an
italian
restaurant)
and
says
he'll
ask
the
italian
wine
expert
to
come
over
and
tell
us
about
them
(okaaayyyy...).it
takes
the
woman
a
while
to
get
to
us
and,
once
she
makes
it
to
our
table,
i
ask
about
the
sangiovese.
she
talks
about
it
very
quickly
and,
before
i
can
ask
about
another
wine,
offers
to
bring
us
a
taste
(okaaaayyy,
again).
she
seems
like
she's
in
a
hurry
to
do
something
so,
we
don't
say
anything
and
she
brings
the
taste
and
walks
away.not
liking
that
wine
either,
we
are
thoroughly
frustrated
as
we
are,
once
again,
left
alone
with
no
wine
and
no
one
to
ask
for
something
different
server
comes
back
to
the
table
and
i
decide
to
order
an
app.
the
bf
is
not
happy
and
wants
to
leave
but
i
am
so
hungry
at
this
point,
i
need
something
to
eat.
after
the
server
leaves,
we
decide
to
also.
we
get
up
to
leave
and
i
let
our
server,
who
is
attending
to
another
table,
that
we
are
going
to
go
and
to
please
cancel
our
appetizer
order
and
i
walk
to
the
front
door.the
italian
wine
expert"
asks
the
bf
why
we
are
leaving
as
our
server
is
explaining
(complaining?)
to
him
that
he
already
put
in
our
appetizer
order
and
brought
us
tastes
of
wine.
she
offers
to
pay
for
our
dinner
but,
he
explains
our
experience
has
already
been
ruined
and
we
just
want
to
leave.this
was,
probably,
the
most
frustrating
experience
i
have
ever
had
at
a
restaurant.

bummer.
so
first
and
foremost,
only
being
open
for
lunch
during
the
weekdays
sucks
for
us!
we've
been
in
seattle
2
years
and
today
was
our
first
visit
because
the
times
don't
work
for
us.
also,
you're
in
downtown,
no
parking,
yada
yada
yada.
there's
a
garage
at
the
corner
of
yesler
for
$6
for
2
hours
(you'll
need
2)
so
save
yourself
some
time
and
just
go
there.
the
line
was
out
the
door
when
we
arrived
at
1pm.
and
just
a
heads
up,
the
line
stretches
the
whole
way
inside,
so
you're
not
even
close
when
you
think
you
are
inside.
we
waited
a
total
of
about
40
minutes.
the
etiquette
is
to
seat
yourself
after
you
order,
and
then
bus
your
own
table.
i
absolutely
hate
the
system.
most
of
the
crowd
we
saw
ended
up
sharing
tables
with
other
parties.
that's
just
not
my
thing.
i
like
space
and
privacy
when
i'm
having
food
out.
then
the
staff
are
shouting
your
name
and
carrying
your
food
through
the
crowd.
it's
just
a
mess
in
my
opinion.
the
menu
had
3
pasta
options.
2
of
them
had
meat
and
one
was
vegetarian
so
if
you
are
vegetarian
your
choice
is
definitely
limited
here.
the
pasta
itself
is
perfect
it's
a
delicious
al
dente
covered
in
just
the
right
amount
of
sauce.
i
had
the
celeriac
and
leek,
which
was
insanely
delicious
i
have
no
doubt
that
any
dish
you
pick
will
be
amazing.
they
are
about
$10
per
dish,
and
it's
a
decent
portion
size.
most
people
i
saw
finished
their
bowl,
but
it
wasn't
too
much
that
you
need
a
nap
afterwards.
the
focaccia
was
moist
and
a
good
addition
to
share
with
the
table.
i
also
enjoyed
the
kale
salad,
which
was
lightly
dressed
(just
like
i
like
it!)
and
a
nice
portion
size
for
the
price.
it
could
easily
be
shared.
our
lunch
for
2
was
about
$35-
decent
price.
staff
at
the
front
taking
orders
were
friendly.
the
place
itself
seems
clean
and
i
saw
staff
wiping
down
tables
after
guests
left.
i
just
don't
think
i'll
be
back
based
on
the
wait
time.
i
don't
like
waiting
in
a
line
watching
people
eat
for
almost
an
hour.
and
then
i
felt
kinda
rushed
to
eat
quickly
once
we
got
our
food.
45ish

not
my
thing.
if
you
have
patience,
i
recommend
trying
them.
if
you
don't
like
crowds,
then
this
probably
won't
be
your
favorite
pasta
place.

get

a
few
months
ago,
so
when
a
few
of
my
grad
school
friends
decided
to
have
a
get
together
for
the
new
year,
i
suggested
this
place
as
i
really
want
to
try
it.i
loved
the
atmosphere
as
soon
as
i
walked
in.
it
had
a
cozy
decor
but
also
elegant
at
the
same
time.
we
got
a
table
towards
the
back
and
i
loved
the
comfortable
cushiony
high
top
chairs.
the
walls
also
have
a
lot
of
plates
decoration.
the
drink
menu
makes
you
want
to
literally
try
everything!
i
settled
for
freddy's
mule
which
had
vodka,
apple
liqueur,
lime,
and
ginger
beer.
yum.
it
was
so
good
that
after
the
first
round,
everyone
in
my
party
decided
to
get
my
drink.
the
food
is
definitely
better
than
your
average
bar
food
which
is
a
blessing!
the
only
thing
that
wasn't
as
great
was
the
vegetable
dumplings.
otherwise,
the
brisket
slider
was
to
die
for!
the
waitress
had
recommended
that
and
she
is
so
right
we
also
got
the
buffalo
spring
rolls.
it
wasn't
bad
but
there
was
this
weird
taste.
maybe
it
had
some
sort
of
cheese
in
the
spring
rolls.
not
sure
we
also
got
two
kinds
of
flatbread.
they
were
both
yummy
i
loved
the
arugula
flatbread.
so
good
honestly,
i
wish
we
tried
more
things
on
the
menu.
they
were
that
good
throughout
the
night,
everyone
was
so
happy
with
the
drinks
and
food
and
that
i
recommended
an
awesome
spot.
now
i
am
responsible
for
picking
out
the
next
spot
for
another

without

can't

anything

about
each
and
every
dish
we
ordered.
from
the

however,
the
dish
that

was
the

you
go
to
a
restaurant
expecting
to
be
completely
blown
away.
something
i
love
about
barley-
the
feeling
is
intimate
but
relaxed
though
it's
a
very
nice
restaurant
you
are
being
served
by
people
who
are
dressed
casually
with
tattoos
or
whatever
else
makes
them
unique
and
they
know
the
dishes
by
heart.
it's
just
more
chill
and
comfortable
than
any
other
restaurant
i
been
to.
i
made
reservations
in
advance
for
the
chef's
tasting
menu
for
two.
we
only
ate
fish
and
they
said
that
wouldn't
be
a
problem...
so
good
there
were
11
dishes,
and
they
were
all
tasty
but
some
stood
out
big
time.
shrimp
dumplings
with
hot
sauce-
especially
interesting
because
you're
expecting
dumplings
with
shrimp
in
them.
wrong
you
get
dumplings
that
have
been
made
out
of
shrimp
creative
different
unique
and
all
those
other
worlds,
plus
delicious
the
shiitake
pasta
with
scrambled
egg
and
grilled
broccoli
was
also
special
the
pasta
was
filled
with
a
very
strong
and
deliciously
cooked
shiitake
mushroom
concoction.
wonderful
flavor
and
texture.
and
my
absolute
favorite-
the
poached
red
snapper.
that
fish
melted
in
my
mouth
and
was
swimming
in
the
most
delicate
delicious
sauce.
the
portion
is
small
but
the
flavors
are
so
special
that
you
want
to
take
small
bites
to
enjoy
every
single
little
bit.
and
a
larger
portion
would
be
too
rich
it
was
perfect
the
blackened
octopus
was
also
particularly
amazing
i
had
never
had
octopus
that
reminded
me
of
chicken,
but
in
a
very
good
way.
it
was
so
smoky
but
tender
and
meaty
all
at
the
same
time.
that
one
was
also
a
big
winner.
not
only
is
it
very
difficult
to
prefect
such
small
amazing
dishes,
but
having
top
notch
service
is
also
very
difficult
just
think,
we
had
at
least
11
dishes
and
every
dish
we
were
given
fresh
silverware
and
often
more
water.
it
was
perfectly
timed
and
executed.
we
don't
usually
treat
ourselves
to
11
course
dinners
but
we
decided
that
this
would
definitely
be
a
place
we'd
come
more
often.

so
fast

the
menu
was
a
little
confusing
but
this
was
because
we
were
expecting
an

with
different

luckily
the
super

explained
there

only
3

aside
from
being

attentive
in

they
made

to

so
nicely
and
with
such
passion
that
it
added
to
the
experience
immensely.
with
each

was
a

of
what
it

how
it
was

whether
there
was

it

to
eat
it,
what
the
sauce
that
they
brought
would
serve
to
do
to
the

etc.
i
really
appreciate
that
kind
of
presentation
that
really
looks
to
maximize
the
patrons'
enjoyment
of
the

we
had
dessert.
it
was

with
a

it

the

been

larger

i

it's
vanilla
ice

and
popcorn
that
commentary
about
the
desert
certainly
doesn't
upend
all
that
was
awesome
about
this
meal.oh,
and
we
can
end
on
a
high
note.
the

which
are

the

is
exceptional
here.
each
dish
is
clearly
cleverly
crafted
and
executed
and
the
service
is
great
however
when
i
brought
a
group
for
new
year's
eve
several
friends
asked
me,
"will
there
be
enough
to
eat."
legitimate
question
since
it's
definitely
more
gourmet
servings.
i
had
previously
eaten
at
the
old
location
and
there
were
17
courses
so
while
small
you
left
fully
satisfied
and
thrilled
with
the
quality.
for
new
year's,
the
set
price
was
much
higher
and
there
was
half
the
courses
from
when
i
had
been
before.
so
the
meal
consisted
of
everyone
giving
me
the
hairy
eyeball
and
feeling
like
i
wanted
to
shrink
under
the
table.
followed
up
by
everyone
being
really
annoyed
when
the
bill
came
and
it
was
a
fortune.
these
are
friends
who
don't
mind
paying
a
fortune
for
dinner
but
they
just
didn't
feel
they
got
the
value.
i
admit,
i
didn't
either.
i
was
pretty
bummed
when
we
got
in
the
car
and
they
asked
me
to
take
them
to

not

we

i

a

the

the

i

the

nonetheless,
this
was
still

i
glad
i
asked
for

because
it
took
this

to
the
next

if
you're
ordering
pickup/to-go,
i
suggest
calling
it
in
as
it
does

a

the

i

of
this
joint
when
i
first
walked
in.
its
a
small
dainty
place
in

not

known
for
its
fresh
fish.
however
once
i
tried
the
poke
bowl,
all
expectations
were
blown
out
of
the
water.
many
poke
bowls
require
you
to
pay
extra
for
avocado
which
makes
your
bowl
$13
-
dollars.
at
simple
it
already
comes
with
delicious
topping
and
a
guacamole
smash
that
is
absolutely
delicious
the
fish
was
fresh
and
flavorful
the
only
thing
that
i
wasn't
too
happy
about
what
the
amount
of
toppings,
because
they
give
you
a
little
too
much
this
place
is
super
affordable
and
gives
you
a
big
bang
for
your
buck!

here
early
is
key

even
though
we
did
during

week
between
christmas
and

we
had
the
standard
long
wait...in
the
cold
at
that.totally
worth
the

though.
i
had
the
pappardelle
bolognese
and
the
castelvetrano

along
with
the
wonderfully
baked

bread.
the
pasta
was
cooked
an

not

was
it
worth
waiting
in

for
this
meal

it
was
worth
galavanting
from
downtown
to
pioneer

as
well.the
seating
can
be
shared
so
you
get
somewhat
of
a

the

is

once

get
through

the

is

there
is
a

just
down
the

if
that's
a

there
is
also
a

not

my
friends
and
i
went
on
a
friday
afternoon
and
as
expected
there
was
a
short
line
that
had
formed
outside
the
door.
we
maybe
waited
5-10
minutes
outside
in
the
chilly
weather
until
we
finally
stepped
inside
the
warm
and
wonderful
aroma
filled
restaurant.
even
though
it
was
extremely
packed
the
atmosphere
felt
content
waiting
in
line
and
watching
everyone
eat
made
me
so
excited
to
order
my
own
plate!
except
my
inner
fat
kid
was
telling
me,
one?!
how
can
you
choose
just
one?!
get
all
three
christina,
do
it!!
so
hell
yeah
i
got
three
pasta
dishes
(usually
only
3
on
the
menu
that
changes
up
daily).
don't
worry
i
didn't
intake
all
those
delicious
carbs
myself,
i
had
my
boyfriend
share
with
me.
after
my
group
and
i
ordered
from
the
sweet
lady
at
the
counter
we
sat
down
and
it
only
took
a
few
minutes
for
all
the
plates
to
arrive.
quick
everyone
take
your
pics
pronto
and
let's
dig
innn.
which
we
did,
and
okay
this
is
where
i
try
fresh
al
dente"
pasta
for
the
first
time
and
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
it
was
over
cooked.
not
gonna
lie
i
always
thought
al
dente
just
meant
once
it's
soft
it's
cooked
and
ready
yeah
no,
it
actually
means
firm
when
bitten.
honest
mistake
really,
so
i
was
definitely
confused
until
some
of
my
friends
informed
me
of
this.once
i
got
over
that
life
altering
moment
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
switching
my
plates
around
to
the
lasagna,
pappardelle
alla
bolognese,
and
pesto
cornetti.
taking
in
every
bite
i
found
the
lasagna
to
be
my
absolute
favorite
and
hello
there
wasn't
even
any
meat
in
it.
that
bechamel
sauce
was
everythaang.
my
boyfriend's
favorite
was
the
pappardelle
cause
he
likes
meat
and
he
loves
having
some
spice
in
his
life.
we
both
agreed
though
that
the
cornetti
was
our
least
favorite
and
even
though
it
was
cheesy
it
had
quite
an
earthy
taste
to
it.
i
say
the
whole
grain
and
arugula
had
a
lot
to
do
with
that
distinct
flavor
that
wasn't
quite
hitting
the
spot
for
us.
after
our
friends
cheered
us
on
to
finish
the
last
bites
of
our
carb
overload
we
bounced
so
other
pasta
lovers
could
get
a
taste
of
the
deliciousness.

is
by
far
the
most
busiest
tourist
attraction
italian
restaurant
i
have
seen
so
far!
i
literally
waited
almost
an
hour
and
half
to
try
there
infamous
pasta!!!
it
was
worth
it
at
the
end
of
the
visit.
if
i
were
to
go
again
i
would
definitely
pick
a
day
that
i
will
be
willing
to
wake
up
early
and
wait
in
line
before
the
place
open
there
restaurant
hour
is
pretty
short
but
i
don't
see
it
surprising
at
all.
it's
from
11am
to
3pm!
after
waited
for
an
hour
when
me
and
my
friend
were
in
the
restaurant
lol
you
still
have
to
wait
until
you
get
to
the
front
to
order
your
food!
they
have
daily
specialties
or
something.
i
ordered
one
of
them
"forgot
the
name"
but
it
was
delicious
there
home
made
bread
was
great
too
very
soft
and
buttery
in
every
bite.
they
should
be
thinking
of
expanding
their
business!
the
restaurant
isn't
that
big
anyway!the
price
is
very
affordable
for
some
freshly
made
italian
pasta
!
if
you
are
a
big
eater
i
would
recommended
order
two
order
pasta
and
a
side
of
there
handmade
bread.
:)
oh
and
friendly
cashier
who
took
my
order
because
i
really
have
no
clue
how
to
say

next
first
time
we
visited
here
on
a
monday
morning
at
1130am,
there
was
a
line
out
the
door.
the
second
time
we
tried
coming
an
hour
before
closing
and
there
was
almost
no
line
with
several
open
tables.
so,
pick
your
timing
well
if
you
don't
feel
like
waiting
in
a
line!
at
this
restaurant
you
order
your
food
first
and
then
sit
down,
so
it's
frowned
upon
to
save
a
seat
before
you
order.the
menu
here
is
always
changing
but
the
pastas
are
always
delicious
we
ordered
1
of
each
pasta
because
we
just
couldn't
choose!
there
were
2
pappardelle
pastas
and
a
gigli
pasta.
there
was
the
pappardelle
de
bolognese
which
is
the
more
common
pasta
on
their
menu,
and
then
the
other
pappardelle
had
anchovies
but
that
was
our
least
favorite
our
favorite
turned
out
to
be
the
vegetarian
gigli
pasta
with
a
rich
and
creamy
sauce
that
was
to
die
for.
we
also
ordered
some
focaccia
which
was
soft
and
airy
and
made
for
a
great
appetizer
or
mop
for
your
extra
overall
the
pasta
here
was
some
of
the
best
we've
ever
had
and
the
staff
there
are
super
friendly.
if
you
end
up
coming
at
a
busy
time
you
may
end
up
having
to
share
a
table
with
another
party.
for
$9
a

i
most
definitely
going
to
make

decided
to

here
on

we
just
had
to
do
it
one
time
for
the
one
time.
the
service,
the
view,
the
overall
experience
was
just
amazing
we
had
the
early
dinner
seating,
waited
in
the
bar/lounge
area.
i
was
kinda
worried
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
find
me
since
i
only
checked
in
with
one
person
who
didn't
even
check
me
off
anywhere,
but
minutes
later,
a
hostess
(who
magically
knew
our
party
name)
approached
us
to
welcome
us
to
our
table.
very
nice
it
was
a
5-course
set
menu.
i
thought
the
portions
were
the
perfect
size
to
be
able
to
fully
enjoy
and
appreciate
each
course
rather
than
trying
to
stuff
huge
dishes
down
my
throat,
trying
to
taste
everything.
our
menu
included
the
aebelskiver
(reminded
me
of
a
doughnut
hole,
it
was
really
nice
and
dainty),
butternut
squash
soup,
carrot
soup
(it
was
served
cold
very
interesting
my
boyfriend
hated
it
but
i
thought
it
was
unique
lol),
lobster
wagyu
ribeye
and
a
chocolate
truffle
dessert.my
favorite
dish
would
have
to
be
the
lobster.
it
was
so
fresh
and
buttery,
the
best
lobster
i've
ever
tasted!
it
was
also
my
boyfriend's
favorite
which
is
saying
a
lot
since
he
doesn't
even
like
lobster.
he
almost
gave
me
his
dish
when
it
came!
i
thought
the
service
was
impeccable
our
servers
took
the
time
to
give
us
information
about
each
dish
after
they
were
brought
out
to
us.
our
main
server,
i
think
his
name
was
dominic
i
soo
sorry
if
it
isn't!
i
thought
he
was
so
warm
and
welcoming,
and
funny
too!
and
i
guess
canlis
is
known
for
their
valet??
no
they
didn't
take
down
our
names
or
give
us
a
ticket
when
we
gave
them
our

and
yes
they
gave
us
back
the
right
car
:)

this

and
found
the

that
i
had
always
hoped
was
there.
the
food
was
full
of
great
fresh
flavors
in
beautiful
presentations,
but
in
small
plates
that
were
completely
accessible
to
my
pallet.we
arrived
at
5:20
pm
on
a
wednesday
and
were
able
to
sit
at
the
bar.
lucky
us,
one
of
our
favorite
bartenders,
casey,
who
we
know
from
many
great
lunches
at
the
bar
at
odd
duck
has
moved
up
north
to
barley
swine
and
greeted
us
with
a
great
big
smile.
robert,
the
bar
manager,
was
also
on
hand
and
made
a
point
to
check
in
and
make
us
feel
welcome
really
really
liked
everything
we
had.
of
everything
the
smoked
fish
salad
was
the
most
bland.
but
i
got
some
delicious
flavors
at
the
end
when
i
was
able
to
incorporate
the
lime-dressed
micro-greens
with
the
avocado
and
fish
salad.
this
was
a
reminder
that
the
key
to
eating
here
it
to
try
to
taste
all
components
of
a
dish
together
in
each
bite.
what
i
loved
about
the
fish
salad
was
the
presentation
of
the
rich
green,
finely
sliced
avocado
exquisitely
molded
over
the
quenelle
of
fish
salad.
the
zucchini
with
apple
and
goat
feta
also
had
a
beautiful
presentation
in
the
shape
of
a
flower.
in
this
case
the
server
was
sure
to
instruct
us
that
although
very
pretty,
the
flower
was
meant
to
be
destroyed
as
we
incorporated
all
ingredients
of
the
dish
together
to
eat.oyster
mushrooms
with
rapini
and
steak
sauce
were
rich
and
filling.
nothing
about
the
description
of
the
shitake
pasta
prepared
us
for
this
dish.
the
pasta
was
formed
into
rectangular
capsules
filled
with
broth
and
sealed.
it
was
an
incredible
sensation
to
bite
into
the
al
dente
fresh
pasta
and
be
greeted
with
a
flood
of
rich
broth.the
masa
pancakes
with
apache
blue
and
hot
sauce
were
hearty
comfort
food.
due
to
a
food
allergy
in
our
party,
we
asked
for
the
hot
sauce
on
the
side,
so
my
photo
here
does
not
represent
the
usual
presentation
of
this
dish.we
finished
our
dining
experience
with
the
chocolate
ice
cream
sandwich
with
mint,
milk
jam
and
pecan
what
the
menu
left
off
the
description
was
the
crunchy
honey
nougat
that
was
crushed
and
crumbled
over
the
dessert.
so
yummy
here
rotate
with
the
season,
so
what
we
had
might
not
be
available
when
you
come.
however,
i
have
faith
in
owner
/
chef
bryce
gilmore
and
his
team
that
they
will
continue
to
create
amazing
dishes,
as
i
had
on
my
most
recent
visit;
and
i
eager
to
try
whatever
they
have
on
the
menu
the
next
time
i
visit.

your

you'll
be
sorely
disappointed
in
the
experience
here
at
barley
swine.
it's
a
tasting
menu
for
starts...my
husband
and
i
are
originally
from
san
francisco:
a
place
where
there
is
an
abundance
of
michelin
star
restaurants.
this
place
combined
the
best
of
two
of
those
restaurants
:
the
modern
and
technical
japanese
cuisine
of
kusakabe,
and
the
organic
down-to-earth
seasonal
menu
of
the
village
pub.dish
after
dish
we
were
surprised
to
see
more
than
just
all-around
amazing-tasting
food.
there
were
plates
presented
to
us
with
the
look
of
a
delicate
asian-inspired
dish
that
tasted
like
the
comforting
meal
that
was
roasted
over
your
backyard
fire
pit.
they
used
their
sauces
to
tie
in
sweet,
savory,
fruity,
and
nutty
elements
throughout
their
courses
-
that's
definitely
a
mark
of
a
great
restaurant
who
knows
their
stuff.thank
you,
barley
swine,
for
a
wonderful
food
experience
that
was
amazing
from
start
to
finish.
the
service
was
very
cordial
and
the
overall
timing
of
the
food
was
well
planned
and
thought
out.

this

what
you
did

the
aftertaste.

the

broccoli
played
a

as

than
the

for
the
adorable

i
would
only
complain
about
the

as
it
didn't
match
the

then
again,
who
cares.

i
ordered
the
salmon

with
all
the
crunches
($9.50).
last
time
i
was
at
pokworks,
i
deeply
regretted
not
asking
for
more
crisps,
so
i
paid
an
extra
$0.50
for
more
wonton
crisps
and
they
loaded
my
bowl
with
just
that,
so
i
was
happy
with
that.
however,
right
as
i
dug
in
and
even
took
a
couple
of
bites,
i
noticed
a
very
small

laying
on
my
salmon.
ahhh,
yes
nothing
like
fresh
salmon
with
a
piece
of
human
dna
at
a
poke
spot
that
supposedly
had
an
a
for
hygiene.
disgusted,
i
immediately
took
a
picture
of
this
(of
course),
but
after
that,
i
took
the
bowl
to
the
counter
to
make
note
of
this.
the
owner
i
pretty
sure
because
she
was
ordering
others
what
to
do)
rudely
asked
"where?"
when
i
told
her
there
was
a
piece
of
hair
in
my
bowl.
she
had
to
take
a
closer
look
before
believing
me
and
she
turned
around
and
muttered
something
to
the
person
preparing
the
bowls.
then
she
turned
to
me
and
said
"we'll
make
another
bowl
for
you."
not
a
single
apology.
clearly
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
attitude
and
her
morale
of
how
to
run
a
i
have
to
admit,
i
was
put
into
a
bad
mood
because
of
the
customer
service,
but
i
gave
the
second
bowl
a
second
chance.
it
indeed
did
fill
me
up,
but
mainly
because
it
was
overloaded
with
carbs,
and
not
so
much
of
the
toppings.
the
salmon
wasn't
very
well
marinated
either.
all
in
all,
i
had
better
pokebowls
for
better
quality
and
for
the
same
price,
not
to
mention
better
customer
service.
