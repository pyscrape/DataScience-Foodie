i had my <adj> first </adj> poke bowl here, and i instantly understood the craze. i got the salmon bowl with <adj> salad </adj> base (no <adj> extra </adj> charge!), which was amazing! the sauce was perfectly balanced, the salmon tasted <adj> fresh </adj>, as did the veges; one bite led me to the <adj> next </adj> and i finished the bowl beyond <adj> satisfied </adj>! my cousin got the squid bowl and was equally <adj> pleased </adj>. however, don't think we would've been <adj> able </adj> to finish the bowl if the meal prior wasn't 8 hours ago and we didn't spent all day walking around soho!

i followed the advice from <adj> previous </adj> reviews and tried their milk tea, and was surprised to find that their boba milk tea was pretty <adj> amazing </adj>! it definitely hopped into my <adj> top </adj> 3 <adj> favorite </adj> shops for boba. tried a sip of my cousin's passion fruit tea, which was <adj> super </adj> refreshing.

housekeepings..
their <adj> amazing </adj> service struck me the most. it's probably the <adj> best </adj> of the <adj> asian </adj> restaurants i've been to. the people seemed <adj> super </adj> <adj> down-to-earth </adj> and just happily doing what they love to do. 

the interior is pretty <adj> small </adj>, as in, two <adj> small </adj> tables and one long table that sat around ~8 (?). there was a <adj> constant </adj> stream of customers while we waited and ate (~8pm). may be plan for take-outs? the decor is <adj> cute </adj> and <adj> hip </adj> though and would probably make a <adj> good </adj> instagram photo if you catch a seat! definitely <adj> come </adj> and check it out!
