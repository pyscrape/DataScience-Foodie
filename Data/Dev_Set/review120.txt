wow! can't wait to go back to list! <adj> happy </adj> hour is a must! food is made for sharing but can easily be the size of an <adj> individual </adj> entre. i highly recommend sharing so you can try <adj> more </adj> items.

we started off with the <adj> grilled </adj> octopus, not overly cooked with a <adj> nice </adj> char. <adj> second </adj> course was the calamari followed by the gnocchi! we ordered a 2nd round of gnocchi because we liked it so much.  i really had no complaints, <adj> great </adj> atmosphere, <adj> delicious </adj> food and <adj> good </adj> service = win.

highly recommend!
