this is a <adj> great </adj> place! my friend and i were going to meet for a show and stopped in for lunch. first, we got a menu in <adj> polish </adj> which we both weren't expecting! it shows how <adj> authentic </adj> it is. we decided on starting with pierogis, mushroom, meat and of course, potato. they had a weekend <adj> special </adj> lunch menu in which i ordered a spinach and <adj> cheese </adj> stuffed turkey with mashed potatoes and cranberries. so <adj> delicious </adj>! and you can't forget their <adj> special </adj> beer. it's a splash of cranberry concentrate juice on their local <adj> polish </adj> beer on tap. everyone was ordering it and seemed very <adj> popular </adj>; it doesn't have a name though. so so <adj> good </adj>!
i definitely recommend coming here!:)
