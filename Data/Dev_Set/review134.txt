list was a <adj> pleasant </adj> detour from our <adj> initial </adj> goal for shiro's. it's <adj> quiet </adj> and <adj> peaceful </adj>. i often <adj> associate </adj> tapas restaurants with a level of pretentiousness. however, the service and presentation at list felt <adj> authentic </adj>, and they just genuinely <adj> love </adj> <adj> great </adj> food and <adj> great </adj> drinks. 

i ordered the sauvig blanc, which complimented my meal. the <adj> complimentary </adj> bread was <adj> good </adj>, except they don't give <adj> enough </adj> olive oil. they will give you <adj> more </adj> if you ask. the sea salt and pepper calamari was the <adj> best </adj> calamari i've ever had. the breading and the softness of the squid was <adj> excellent </adj>. it felt like i was eating <adj> puffy </adj> clouds of squid.

the bacon wrapped <adj> wild </adj> gulf prawns was <adj> good </adj>. the beans underneath were strangely spicy in comparison. i wouldn't recommend the <adj> grilled </adj> chilean sea bass. i don't know what sustainably caught means, but the sea bass was <adj> average </adj> and it was almost on the <adj> chewy </adj> side. i've had better elsewhere and the sauces underneath it don't seem to help.
