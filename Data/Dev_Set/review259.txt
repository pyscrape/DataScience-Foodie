i was at volunteer park and hangry so i checked yelp for <adj> highest </adj> rated purveyors of food herb & bitter came up so we went.

we had the duck pate which was <adj> more </adj> of a mousse than anything. it came with a <adj> golden </adj> raspberry confiture, cornichons and grilled bread. all very very <adj> good </adj>.  for our <adj> main </adj> meal we had the <adj> wild </adj> boar meatballs in mole and i'd say it's one of the <adj> better </adj> moles in the area and a lot <adj> better </adj> than the stuff pushed at <adj> meximerican </adj> restaurants. 

for beer we like porters and stouts but the only thing they had on draft was anchor, possibly the <adj> worst </adj> porter on the planet in my opinion so we picked up a bottle of <adj> old </adj> rasputin instead which was very <adj> nice </adj> if a bit <adj> stiff </adj>.

<adj> overall </adj>, <adj> great </adj> environment and <adj> good </adj> <adj> friendly </adj> service.
