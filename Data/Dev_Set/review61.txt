thursday kitchen truly is the <adj> perfect </adj> name for such a <adj> unique </adj>, <adj> whimsical </adj> restaurant. everyone goes out for dinner on the weekend, but there is something to be said about a <adj> dining </adj> experience or even a dinner plan on a thursday. and that <adj> unique </adj>... <adj> unicorn </adj> quality is something that thursday kitchen definitely emanates from the <adj> light-up </adj> capri-thursday cocktails to the beautifully <adj> envisioned </adj> <adj> korean </adj> interpretations of tapas.

i'm going to be <adj> honest </adj>, the thing that dragged my <adj> lazy </adj> <adj> californian </adj> butt out to the <adj> east </adj> village from midtown on the <adj> snowiest </adj> day of the winter so far, and queue for almost an hour to get a seat, was the menu. and i promise you... it was <adj> worth </adj> it. 

when we finally sat down, our waitress recommended we have 2 tapas each in order for it to be filling. she was <adj> right </adj> - i would highly recommend ordering to that ratio. it seems <adj> small </adj>, but the timing at which the food comes out makes it a very <adj> satisfying </adj> meal. <adj> overall </adj>, the breakdown of the menu between "starch, veggies, meat, seafood" made it a very <adj> easy </adj> menu to navigate and make our decisions.
