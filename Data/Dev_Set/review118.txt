dutch freds is a <adj> great </adj> place for cocktails and bites in a rowdy theatre district bar. it is not a <adj> good </adj> place for <adj> quick </adj> service or a "<adj> sit-down </adj>" dinner. <adj> most </adj> of the tables, save for a <adj> few </adj> up front, are <adj> high-tops </adj> and <adj> good </adj> for standing around. this used to be the <adj> irish </adj> <adj> dive </adj> bar blarney stone...but there's nothing left that is even <adj> remotely </adj> reminiscent of that place. and it is <adj> loud </adj>! 

from the makers of tanner smith's (home of the <adj> best </adj> <adj> eggplant </adj> chips in the world), this <adj> great </adj> cocktail bar is a <adj> nice </adj> addition to the neighborhood, but it very quickly became a bro hangout in the neighborhood. it's not a sports bar...but it sure does feel like one!

the food is <adj> good </adj>. it's basically the <adj> same </adj> menu as tanner's and that is <adj> a-ok </adj> by me. i do wish that each place had their <adj> own </adj> <adj> special </adj> features...because it's just starting to feel like a <adj> homegrown </adj> applebee's with food that won't make you <adj> sick </adj>. 

come <adj> ready </adj> to spend a bit <adj> more </adj> than you're <adj> prepared </adj> to (because the cocktails really are <adj> spectacular </adj>...and <adj> expensive </adj>) and if you're <adj> hungry </adj>, you'll be <adj> fine </adj>. i just wouldn't recommend planning on making a meal of it here. and be <adj> ready </adj> to yell to be heard by your companions, bar tender or <adj> wait </adj> staff member.
