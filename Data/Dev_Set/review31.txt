although canlis can be named as the most <adj> high-end </adj>, <adj> prestigious </adj> restaurant in town, it also raises your expectations and thus it should be <adj> good </adj> enough to deliver on those expectations. 
yes, there is a dress code; men are expected to wear a jacket and a tie, specially if you are sitting by the window. it has an <adj> amazing </adj> view of the city and you can go a <adj> little </adj> bit earlier, sit at the bar area and enjoy a <adj> well-prepared </adj> cocktail and the view.
you are expected to book a table; does not mean walk-ins are not <adj> welcome </adj>, but you might have to wait longer. our table was booked for 8:45 and we got there at 8 to have a couple of drinks, but were seated around 9. the place was packed and it was on a thursday night.
it is a <adj> good </adj> idea to allocate about 3 hours to this dining experience; with the wait to be seated taken into consideration and <adj> different </adj> dishes to be served, it could well be over three hours. 
you can choose between a <adj> three-course </adj> or a <adj> 4-course </adj> menu and for two people having a <adj> three-course </adj> menu and a couple of drinks, our bill added up to $300. you are dropping <adj> big </adj> bucks here, but i imagine you save canlis for a <adj> special </adj> occasion; ours was our <adj> 5th </adj> anniversary.
the <adj> best </adj> thing about canlis is not the food, but the service. i can't remember having had a <adj> better </adj> service anywhere else here in the us or any <adj> other </adj> country. we were asked at the beginning of dinner what the occasion was, and were congratulated <adj> several </adj> times during dinner and again <adj> prior </adj> to leaving the restaurant. although <adj> many </adj> people were dining there, it felt as if we were the <adj> only </adj> two people eating there. service was <adj> spectacular </adj>!!!
the food was mostly hit, but had a <adj> few </adj> misses. while the fois gras and the filet mignon were <adj> exceptional </adj>, the salmon was very <adj> underwhelming </adj> and bland, smelled fishy and was not appetizing. there were some sides you could order with your <adj> entree </adj> and we got the mushrooms as the side for filet mignon and that mushroom alone was <adj> better </adj> than two entrees combined.
it was definitely a night to remember. the service definitely made our night.....it was such a pleasure having the chance to try the dishes of the <adj> talented </adj> chef at canlis.
