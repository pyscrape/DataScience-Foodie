i have <adj> polish </adj> friends. i've been to greenpoint several times over the years. but why i have never had <adj> polish </adj> food (a homemade salad, if you count that), i don't know. but i'm totally <adj> hooked </adj> and will never refuse if offered any food in a <adj> polish </adj> household again.

<adj> polish </adj> food is amazing. the <adj> inside </adj> resembles a medieval household where you can come home to enjoy a homemade comfort meal after a <adj> long </adj> day of labor work--even the waiters are dressed in <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> folk costumes that'll take you away from the <adj> modern </adj> world. 

what can i say...almost everything here is <adj> delicious </adj>, guaranteed. even if it's "<adj> bad </adj>," it's not <adj> worse </adj> than any <adj> bad </adj> meal i've ever had.  since it is a <adj> family-style </adj> restaurant, the portions are <adj> huge </adj>. you can easily be <adj> semi-bloated </adj> from the potato pancakes--the mushroom sauce that comes with them is <adj> running-for-the-hills </adj> amazing. after killing two of these, you may want to reconsider your need for an entree.

if you plan on getting the <adj> white </adj> borscht, try not to get an entree, unless you can really work up an appetite. this is pretty much a meal itself since it is <adj> creamy </adj> and <adj> heavy </adj> and served with <adj> mashed </adj> potatoes. i had ordered the chicken kebab plate (which comes in two <adj> massive </adj> skewers with fries and a <adj> whole </adj> plate of salad), totally underestimating the <adj> huge </adj> portions of the food, and wanted nothing of it after the borscht and some appetizers. i didn't think the borscht was anything <adj> special </adj> but soup in a bread bowl isn't <adj> common </adj> in <adj> new </adj> york, so that might easily attract people. i've also tried their hunter's stew, which might be <adj> heavy </adj> for some people; it is cooked with <adj> red </adj> wine and has a <adj> strong </adj> tomato taste to it. 

if you've never had <adj> polish </adj> food, this is the probably the <adj> best </adj> place to start. it's very homely and the staff members are such <adj> warm </adj>, <adj> friendly </adj> people.
