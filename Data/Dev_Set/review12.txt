dee dee in thai means "<adj> good </adj> <adj> good </adj>" (<adj> double </adj> <adj> good </adj>? <adj> good </adj> squared? <adj> dee-lightful </adj>?) and that's an <adj> apt </adj> description of the food and service we experienced during our <adj> relaxed </adj> <adj> unofficial </adj> yelp event (<adj> uye </adj>) by mr. smidgens on a <adj> recent </adj> <adj> sunny </adj> spring <adj> sunday </adj> afternoon. the charming food truck proprietor couple, justin and lakana, served up for us a <adj> generous </adj> parade of plates of their <adj> favorite </adj> <adj> northern </adj> thai street food recipes, and everything really was <adj> sooooo </adj> <adj> good </adj>.

the current simple menu features minced and thinly sliced pork, flavorfully marinated and accompanied by <adj> sticky </adj> rice (love!!), assorted <adj> fresh </adj> crisp veggies, and <adj> garden-grown </adj> herbs. while the list of ingredients is <adj> short </adj>, the dishes deliver <adj> big </adj> on taste and texture. i adore thai food (especially anything spicy or seasoned with basil or <adj> lime </adj> leaves), so <adj> dee </adj> <adj> dee </adj> hit my palate in all the <adj> right </adj> places.

pad kra pow: sauteed seasoned <adj> minced </adj> pork with a <adj> light </adj> housemade spicy fish sauce, <adj> sticky </adj> rice, fried egg, cucumber

moo ping: overnight marinated, grilled pork skewers with <adj> sticky </adj> rice and spicy dipping sauce

<adj> larb </adj> moo: spicy & sour minced pork with <adj> fresh </adj> thai herbs, <adj> sticky </adj> rice, thai basil, <adj> cold </adj> cucumber

mango <adj> sticky </adj> rice: <adj> dessert </adj> dish sweetened with coconut creme sauce and a perfectly ripened fruit

i just cannot wait until her <adj> wickedly </adj> pungent, not for amateurs <adj> som </adj> tum with crab makes onto the menu; lakana was worried that we wouldn't be <adj> able </adj> to handle it, but i say, "bring it on!" for pics of what <adj> else </adj> lakana has in store for us as the menu grows, check out her <adj> colorful </adj> instagram at https://www.instagram.com/deedeeatx/

know before you go:

parking and getting into the place can be a <adj> little </adj> <adj> tricky </adj>, what with <adj> popular </adj> smokehouse la barbecue in the <adj> same </adj> lot plus stay gold and craftsman right <adj> next </adj> door. don't worry! you can park a block or so <adj> north </adj> and <adj> sneak </adj> into the yard via the <adj> back </adj> alley off chicon or <adj> chapa </adj> street.

this is an <adj> outdoor </adj> dining experience in a <adj> pea </adj> <adj> gravel-covered </adj> yard, so <adj> wear </adj> <adj> appropriate </adj> footwear and be prepared for the weather. 

bonus: byob!
