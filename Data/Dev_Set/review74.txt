we came in on a <adj> friday </adj> night and was quoted a 2 hour wait but it turned into a 2 hour 45 min wait. they can't be blamed for this since it is <adj> hard </adj> to predict how <adj> fast </adj> tables will turn. however, what they did have control over was the fact that they allowed their friends to walk in and instantly get a table without waiting, despite the <adj> long </adj> wait time. also, we witnessed someone else slipping the owner money after hearing how <adj> long </adj> the wait would be. definitely not <adj> fair </adj> for the rest of us! 

what would have become a <adj> total </adj> disaster quickly escalated into a <adj> wonderful </adj> meal once we were finally seated. the staff were <adj> super </adj> <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> knowledgable </adj> about their menu and the food was absolutely <adj> amazing </adj>. i must admit i was a bit <adj> skeptical </adj> at <adj> first </adj>, but the dishes exceeded my expectations.

my favorites:
kimchi paella: creamy and <adj> full </adj> of flavor although it is too <adj> liquidy </adj> to be considered a paella.  
steak: cooked to perfection. the steak was very juicy and the <adj> sauted </adj> kale was seasoned perfectly.
truffle mac and cheese- cheesy mozzarella, truffles, & clams. what's not to love?
<adj> popcorn </adj> ice cream- tasted like the cracker jack <adj> popcorn </adj> in ice cream form. 

items i would skip <adj> next </adj> time:
octopus- <adj> good </adj> but the portion of the octopus is too <adj> small </adj>. i did enjoy the sauce drenched on <adj> top </adj> though.
eel taco: flavors were just okay. i didn't think that the eel went well as a taco. the taste of the torch used was empowering. 

i think i would come back to try some of the other items on the menu and to revisit some of the ones i really enjoyed! hopefully the wait won't be as <adj> long </adj> <adj> next </adj> time around.
