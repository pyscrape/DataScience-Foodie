the decor and ambiance is <adj> great </adj>. cozy.

waiter was <adj> positive </adj> and <adj> helpful </adj> on wine and food selections.
but too <adj> busy </adj> <adj> overall </adj> and he rarely was to be seen. waited quite a while to place orders.

the disappointment was on food. the 'assagio' which is an assortment of ravioli and gnocchi was really not compelling at all. the gnocchi were quite <adj> overdone </adj>, and just <adj> mushy </adj> balls of something. nothing tasted <adj> good </adj> at all! that was definitely 2 stars.

burrata <adj> appetizer </adj> way too <adj> small </adj>.

my dish, which was <adj> wild </adj> boar and fettucine was better. i'd rate that 3 stars, as in a ok.

friends chicken dish was quite <adj> good </adj>, i'd give that 3 stars, maybe 3.5.

wine selection was 3 stars. <adj> decent </adj> price ($40) and <adj> decent </adj> quality.

so <adj> overall </adj> 3 stars. but those ravioli really sucked. 

i would not return here.
