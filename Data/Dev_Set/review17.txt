may i say wow?! one of the <adj> many </adj> reasons i love visiting austin, food truck culture! there is a food truck for almost every type of food you can think of and it never disappoints. let me start by saying that my mouth is still burning from the om gai but it's a <adj> good </adj> thing. om gai is a soup with lots of cilantro, chicken, dill and zucchini and it is <adj> spicy </adj>! but of course <adj> delicious </adj>! the broth is <adj> light </adj> but <adj> packed </adj> with flavor, the <adj> sticky </adj> rice acts like a bread and it absorbs all the deliciousness in the broth. i also tried the thai tea and it was <adj> perfect </adj>, not too <adj> sweet </adj>, <adj> flavorful </adj> and <adj> creamy </adj> enough. loved this place, definitely give it a try and don't be afraid of the spice, they can accommodate the level of spice depending on te dish.
