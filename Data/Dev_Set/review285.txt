<adj> amazing </adj> <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> food - such a <adj> hidden </adj> gem! i usually wouldn't think to try <adj> polish </adj> food as 90% of the people i hang out with are <adj> asian </adj>, but my co-workers took me here for lunch and this has become one of my <adj> favorite </adj> restaurants in <adj> new </adj> york!

restaurant has a <adj> rustic </adj> atmosphere with <adj> wooden </adj> tables and benches, with the waitresses dressed in <adj> traditional </adj> dresses. 

<adj> lunch </adj> specials are such a <adj> great </adj> value - <adj> lunch </adj> plate with soup at only $10.50 and the portions are <adj> huge </adj>. i love the <adj> white </adj> borscht soup - which comes with <adj> mashed </adj> potatoes on the side. my kind of food!  there are about <adj> 6-7 </adj> <adj> lunch </adj> dishes to choose from. i really enjoyed the <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage with <adj> polish </adj> kielbasa or 3 pierogis, and <adj> polish </adj> kielbasa with hunter stew. so <adj> flavorful </adj> and <adj> tasty </adj>!  can be a <adj> little </adj> <adj> heavy </adj> for <adj> lunch </adj> - but they provide boxes if you want to pack the rest to go. 

outside of the lunch options i recommend the plate of barbecue for two or three people - it is a meat lover's heaven! it comes with (sausage, <adj> white </adj> sausage, <adj> black </adj> pudding, pork, skewers of chicken and pork, salmon, chicken breast, bacon) and only for $27 total! i couldn't believe it. portions were <adj> huge </adj> - enough to feed a family of 4. i loved everything!

everything here is a <adj> good </adj> value, but <adj> best </adj> of all, the food is amazingly <adj> delicious </adj>. highly recommend!
