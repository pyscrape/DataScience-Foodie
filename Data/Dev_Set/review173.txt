i rarely hand out 5s, and while i could nit pick my way down to a 4.5 (slightly <adj> slow </adj> service, <adj> uncomfortable </adj> seating) im gonna suck it up and give them their due.  <adj> fantastic </adj> menu, wonderfully <adj> attentive </adj> service when it comes to placing and charming <adj> wait </adj> staff.  

number 1: their "mixologists", a <adj> trendy </adj> term by they deserve to be called something official sounding, are absolutely on point.  every cocktail was something <adj> new </adj>, crisp, layered, <adj> delicious </adj>.  botanist gin is my <adj> favorite </adj> and they paired it with fruit flavors and jalapeno, expertly balanced.  the aviator with <adj> floral </adj> undertones, and the rum apple offering was like a <adj> perfect </adj> adult apple cider.  

they started us off with some canapes, some type of <adj> fried </adj> crispy shell with <adj> molten </adj> goat cheese inside.  <adj> awesome </adj>.  <adj> next </adj> was the beet with <adj> marrow </adj> butter.  not <adj> popular </adj> at the table, but an <adj> interesting </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj> experience none the <adj> less </adj>.  the tempura mushroom with egg custard was <adj> divine </adj>.  we had pork skin "pasta" with <adj> shrimp </adj> dumplings and those dumplings i could have eaten by the dozen.  i also loved the pork <adj> noodle </adj>, very <adj> gelatinous </adj>.  <adj> gluten </adj> <adj> free </adj>.  ;)  

the <adj> charred </adj> squash was a <adj> good </adj> portion, a <adj> nice </adj> break from the very <adj> rich </adj> courses just prior.  the <adj> red </adj> shrimp was cooked so perfectly and with such finesse it tasted like incredibly tender lobster.  we had some type of vinegar and tarragon "<adj> bubble </adj> tea" shooter as a palette cleanser.  again, not particularly <adj> popular </adj> with the less <adj> adventurous </adj> but i enjoyed it.  pork shoulder's presentation was <adj> perfect </adj> and quaint and the coconut bread was a <adj> massive </adj> hit.  

rib eye steak i could have used a bit more char on the <adj> outside </adj> but it was absolutely cooked perfectly, with incredibly <adj> crispy </adj> hash on the side.  i could also have eaten a <adj> whole </adj> plate of this myself.  actually, can i just order a <adj> whole </adj> plate of this one night, pretty please?  

duck i'm not a fan of <adj> most </adj> places and it was <adj> good </adj> here but i let my duck loving wife have the majority of my offering.  

<adj> next </adj> up is something really <adj> special </adj>.  the lemongrass sorbet could have possibly been <adj> better </adj> if it were just lemon, but the <adj> real </adj> star was the texture.  rice pudding with <adj> crispy </adj> rice and other toppings that offered an incredibly <adj> fun </adj> and <adj> adventurous </adj> tasting.  i rarely feel like a dish is "<adj> fun </adj>" but this one you couldn't help but play with it in your mouth as you explored the <adj> different </adj> textures.  aaa---

the chocolate cake at the end was <adj> fine </adj> and maybe the only thing i'd say is "<adj> average </adj>".  since it was my birthday they served me a slice of carrot cake with goat cheese icing.  <adj> great </adj>, never had anything like it!

finished up with some macarones, which i love but were, again, nothing absolutely <adj> spectacular </adj>, but they had a <adj> tough </adj> act to follow.

you need to go to this restaurant.
