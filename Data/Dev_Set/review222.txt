update after reply: hello! thank you for the response and explanation. my review wasn't based on what i feel, but based on the fact (<adj> key </adj> word) that the prices don't add up to $140. i understand it wasn't your intention to make groupon users feel cheated, but groupon users are looking for a deal, that's the <adj> whole </adj> purpose of groupon. then when you calculate the <adj> original </adj> value without using the logic that anyone looking for a deal would use, it doesn't make sense. no one would buy each item individually for the <adj> highest </adj> price <adj> possible </adj> if there's a tasting menu that is <adj> cheaper </adj> and even gives an <adj> extra </adj> desert. for things to look <adj> fair </adj> you could say the deal is the tasting menu for two people ($45 - $45) and then that means 2 desserts. then a bottle of wine for $40 and you make <adj> sure </adj> the wines in the list are all <adj> worth </adj> $40, not like the one we got with <adj> undisclosed </adj> price and advertised as $7 a glass in the online menu. btw, about the menu being outdated on the website, would be <adj> great </adj> to fix that, <adj> most </adj> people honor the <adj> lowest </adj> price when prices advertised diverge. finally, i did try to contact groupon about the deal but they said the sellers can advertise any price they want and they couldn't do anything about it. i also talked to the waitress about the wines not having prices and explained i wanted to make the deal <adj> worth </adj> it and she didn't help with that and reassured that was the groupon deal wine list i had to choose from.
i'll increase the review to 3 stars, but i still feel things could have been addressed in a <adj> better </adj> way.

the restaurant is <adj> good </adj> and the food portions are <adj> big </adj> so we were very <adj> full </adj> in the end. what i really hated was that we got a groupon "deal" where the <adj> original </adj> price was $140 and deal price was $89. the <adj> original </adj> price doesn't make any sense. down to the math, i see in the vin santo website the <adj> following </adj> item in the dinner menu: 3 course tasting menu (choice of salad or <adj> piatti </adj> piccoli, <adj> main </adj> course and dessert) for $38. if we buy 2 of those it would cost $76 and we would get an <adj> extra </adj> dessert (the groupon only offers one dessert to share). the groupon included a bottle of wine of up to $40, but in the restaurant they give us a list of wines to choose than don't come with prices, so they could as well be $20. the one we got costs $7 a glass in the website menu, so i'm <adj> sure </adj> it wouldn't cost $40 if we ordered simply <adj> many </adj> glasses of that wine. so summing the food ($76, minus one dessert that i will disregard) with the mystery priced wine (let's say $40, i'll also disregard the lack of clarity with the price) we still have $116 and not $140. but we are charged 9% tax over $140 and are requested to tip over $140. i wish there was <adj> more </adj> clarity on this groupon deal, as the math just doesn't add up and we felt cheated.
