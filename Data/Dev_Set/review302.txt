<adj> great </adj> cozy and <adj> loud </adj> spot for a <adj> quick </adj> drink and tapas. located in a basement on <adj> orchard </adj> street. came here to meet some friends for <adj> pre-dinner </adj> drinks. they tucked us in a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> little </adj> corner near the back. 

drinks: tried the hibiscus royale - all made with their <adj> house-made </adj> syrups. the drink ran on the <adj> sweet </adj> side, but was still <adj> delicious </adj> regardless

tapas: baked portobello with <adj> garlic </adj>, <adj> bread </adj> crumbs, olive oil and herbs - 3 pieces to an order, and this was just absolutely <adj> delicious </adj>. i am always a fan of stuffed mushrooms, and these were <adj> generous </adj> sized portobello caps cooked perfectly. the stuffing was not <adj> mushy </adj> or <adj> overly </adj> crunchy. loved this dish!

sea scallop carpaccio with salmon caviar, yuzu, and spices - <adj> less </adj> than <adj> impressed </adj> with this dish. the salmon caviar was too <adj> overpowering </adj> and took away from the <adj> delicate </adj> flavor of the sea scallop. the yuzu and spices were <adj> great </adj>, but unfortunately still overpowered by the salmon caviar. we didn't enjoy this dish as much.

service: was amazing! the <adj> wait </adj> staff were so <adj> friendly </adj>, <adj> attentive </adj>, and fun! they made <adj> sure </adj> since we sat near the <adj> a/c-heating </adj> unit that we felt <adj> comfortable </adj> with the temperature and always adjusted it to our needs. loved this place for its ambiance and drinks, and though we only tried two dishes, we would love to come back and try <adj> more </adj> on the menu!
