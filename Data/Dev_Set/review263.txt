<adj> delicious </adj>

<adj> oh </adj> man are we <adj> glad </adj> kichin opened up walking distance from our apartment. my favorites are the bibimbap and the <adj> grilled </adj> chicken bowl, both of which you can get on rice or a <adj> salad </adj> if you're feeling <adj> healthy </adj>. both are piled with tender meat and <adj> fresh </adj> vegetables and make a super filling, but <adj> nutritious </adj> dinner. my boyfriend and i have been here half a dozen times now between the two of us, and have always loved our food. his favorites are the rice balls, especially the <adj> avocado </adj> edamame. 

the food is a <adj> little </adj> <adj> expensive </adj> for a <adj> takeaway </adj> place in this neighborhood, but the food is so <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj>, <adj> i </adj> think it's completely <adj> worth </adj> it. the <adj> iced </adj> teas are also <adj> tasty </adj>. the guys running the place are <adj> friendly </adj> and seem to really care about the food. seating is a <adj> little </adj> <adj> limited </adj>, but the food travels well and it's <adj> easy </adj> to pick up and take elsewhere.
