this was about an <adj> average </adj> experience. they had lots of beer, wine, and liquor options which was a <adj> plus </adj>. <adj> cool </adj> location and <adj> nice </adj> decor.
i found the bartenders and staff pretty <adj> rude </adj> - i was worried we had come in right before closing because they made us feel so <adj> unwelcome </adj>, but they weren't closing for over an hour. we had the avocado and chorizo dip that was pretty <adj> yummy </adj> and i liked the drinks. 
they were showing <adj> blade </adj> runner and some <adj> other </adj> <adj> weird </adj> movie, which i thought was <adj> cool </adj>. 
<adj> overall </adj> it was <adj> fine </adj>, but it was <adj> expensive </adj>, the service wasn't <adj> great </adj>, and there are lots of <adj> other </adj> options <adj> available </adj> nearby
