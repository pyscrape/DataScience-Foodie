this was absolutely my <adj> favorite </adj> place to eat at in seattle!

<adj> i </adj>'ve gone here 3 out of the 6 days that <adj> i </adj> was in <adj> seattle </adj> because <adj> i </adj> was very <adj> impressed </adj> with the <adj> happy </adj> hour menu. <adj> i </adj> came as a party of 2 each time <adj> i </adj> ate here and never had to wait <adj> more </adj> than 40 mins for a spot (even though the restaurant was always <adj> full </adj> and we were given estimates of <adj> 1-1.5 </adj> hrs).

<adj> i </adj>'ve only ordered from the <adj> happy </adj> hour menu and enjoyed every <adj> single </adj> item <adj> i </adj> ordered. food on the <adj> happy </adj> hour menu range between $6-9 and the portions are <adj> generous </adj>. <adj> i </adj>'ve ordered the handmade gnocchi with <adj> black </adj> truffle cream; flatbread with <adj> feta </adj> cheese, cranberries, and pine nuts; sea salt and pepper calamari; spicy meatballs; grilled octopus salad; <adj> bacon-wrapped </adj> prawns; grilled <adj> chilean </adj> sea bass; and seared ahi <adj> tuna </adj> fillets.

everything was seriously <adj> delicious </adj>, but, out of the items <adj> i </adj> ordered, <adj> i </adj> highly recommend the gnocchi (it was heavenly!), spicy meatballs, salt and pepper calamari, and grilled <adj> chilean </adj> sea bass! 

this is a spot that <adj> i </adj> will look forward to eating at when <adj> i </adj> visit seattle again!
