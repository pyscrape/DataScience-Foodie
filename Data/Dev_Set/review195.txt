on a <adj> rare </adj> day off, i decided to visit <adj> il </adj> corvo for lunch. can't believe it's been over a year and a half since i <adj> last </adj> <adj> visited </adj>! <adj> ten </adj> minutes before opening, i'm <adj> eighth </adj> in line. the line ends up being the entire length of the restaurant, out the door and up the sidewalk towards 3rd and james. continuously during lunch rush. folks know though that their patience will be handsomely rewarded.

i'm making the <adj> most </adj> of it by buying some pasta shells from their studio, four signature shortbread, the prosciutto pickled celery plate, and my <adj> favorite </adj> <adj> dish </adj> - the papparadelle with <adj> scrumptious </adj> meat sauce topped with <adj> cheese </adj>! i was surprised that the guy behind the counter had faint recognition and wondered where i'd been all this time. telling him i work now in lynnwood is all he had to know, as he carefully packaged up the pasta and shortbread.

dining solo i made <adj> quick </adj> work of my <adj> mega </adj> starter and pasta bowl. as i was finishing my <adj> last </adj> four bites, another couple asked to share my table. it's a <adj> fleeting </adj> thing, really with the line out the door, one has to relinquish <adj> valuable </adj> dining space which i was <adj> happy </adj> to do.

the sun was out, my <adj> tummy </adj> very <adj> satisfied </adj>, <adj> big </adj> smile across my face, and i was in <adj> downtown </adj> seattle...thanks again chef <adj> mike </adj> easton and staff! your <adj> culinary </adj> magic remains <adj> genuine </adj>, <adj> consistent </adj>, and for now, the <adj> closest </adj> i can get to italy using my imagination. grazie mille!
