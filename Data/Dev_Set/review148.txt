i like it here. with the exception of one irritating customer service issue, i have been a <adj> long </adj> time fan. their food is <adj> inventive </adj> and fun while maintaining <adj> classic </adj> flavors. i love the mussels with sausage and <adj> red </adj> sauce they used to serve. if they bring that back, i'd go everyday. ha!

but the wine list, the food... it's all <adj> delicious </adj>. it's a <adj> good </adj> place to check out, <adj> nice </adj> patio and <adj> great </adj> location.
