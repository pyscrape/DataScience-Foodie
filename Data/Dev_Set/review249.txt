this is now on my <adj> top </adj> <adj> favorite </adj> broadway bar and eating <adj> establishment </adj> list.  this place is <adj> classy </adj>, <adj> eclectic </adj>, and <adj> whimsical </adj>.  passion went into building this space, and goes into making the food and drinks every night.  the menu focuses on locally sourced and <adj> seasonal </adj> ingredients (whenever <adj> possible </adj>).  the food has a <adj> slight </adj> <adj> spanish </adj> medditeranean focus.  <adj> many </adj> of the dishes are made to be <adj> small </adj> and <adj> shareable </adj>.  their cocktials change seasonally, and they even barrel age some of their cocktails and spirits in house.  they have a <adj> comprensive </adj> bar program centered around <adj> italian </adj> <adj> amari </adj> drinks.  their cocktail menu is divided between bitter and herb focused drinks.  you can find the drink menu on the table in the children book covers.  

the space is <adj> beautiful </adj> and the <adj> interior </adj> design is amazing.  inside is <adj> cozy </adj>, <adj> dark </adj>, and <adj> classic </adj>.  walk to the back and you enter an indoor/outdoor <adj> patio </adj> area with a <adj> retractable </adj> roof and lights.

staff were <adj> friendly </adj> and accommodated food sensitivities well.  the food was cooked to perfection.  very <adj> tasty </adj> and <adj> fresh </adj>.  i loved my <adj> catalonian </adj> <adj> fish </adj> stew and my friends loved the <adj> spanish </adj> adobo beef skewers and baby <adj> kale </adj> ceasar salad.  the <adj> spanish </adj> cheese plate though with the <adj> special </adj> nuts were amazing!!! everything looked as <adj> good </adj> as it tasted.  the desserts they said were also <adj> delicious </adj> - the olive oil yogurt sponge cake and chocolate coconut pot de crme.

the highlight was the craft cocktails. while the food was <adj> great </adj>, the cocktails were <adj> incredible </adj>!  very <adj> unique </adj> flavors blended together. combinations of flavors i have never seen together on a drink menu.  <adj> creative </adj> and <adj> talented </adj> bartenders! 

we had a very <adj> enjoyable </adj> time here.
