i've been in this area for years and on this <adj> same </adj> <adj> exact </adj> block and had no idea that excuse my french was located in a <adj> little </adj> <adj> cozy </adj> basement. i had dinner here on a thursday and it was very <adj> packed </adj>. don't worry, grab a beer <adj> next </adj> door at <adj> top </adj> hops while you wait. the only thing that i didn't like at excuse my french was the seating. it's basically a <adj> long </adj> bar all the way down except for a couple <adj> small </adj> tables in the front. 

as we seated at the bar, the waitress recommended a <adj> nice </adj> <adj> french </adj> red that was very <adj> good </adj>. we ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. we started with a bunch of cheeses and charcuterie. they paired nicely together especially with a <adj> little </adj> wine sip. we also ordered the duck rillettes which was probably my <adj> favorite </adj> thing the <adj> whole </adj> night. we shared a <adj> steamed </adj> artichoke for the table. cooked nicely and brought back childhood memories which can sound <adj> weird </adj>. my other <adj> favorite </adj> dish was the sea scallop carpaccio. cut very <adj> thin </adj> with a lot of flavor. it's topped with salmon caviar and yuzu. 

for my entree, i ordered the duck confit parmentier which is a <adj> gorgeous </adj> presentation. it's paired with <adj> crushed </adj> potatoes, olive oil and truffle pure. this dish was pretty <adj> good </adj> but i thought it would be better. <adj> next </adj> time, i'll listen to reviews and order the foie gras lollipops. heard they are amazing.

for dessert, they gave the table a <adj> free </adj> crepe. i kid you not, it's because they liked my cousin. it worked out well for me because it was <adj> delicious </adj> and a <adj> great </adj> way to finish a meal.
