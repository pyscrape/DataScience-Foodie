dee dee indeed!! 

with a hankering for thai food, i searched yelp for something in my neighborhood and decided to give dee dee a try! 

the trailer was fairly <adj> busy </adj> on a <adj> thursday </adj> night around 8pm. we ordered the pad kra pow (pork), the om gai (chicken), and <adj> som </adj> tom papaya salad. since they were <adj> busy </adj>, we waited about <adj> 15-20 </adj> minutes, which i didn't think was that long. when our food was almost <adj> ready </adj>, the owner apologized for the wait and gave us some sparkling waters! a very <adj> nice </adj> gesture! 

we took our food to-go and dug in when we got home. everything was <adj> super </adj> <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj> with <adj> complex </adj> flavors. my <adj> favorite </adj> dish was the pad kra pow, which packs a spicy punch balanced with <adj> fresh </adj> herbs and cucumber. the papaya salad was <adj> super </adj> spicy, <adj> delicious </adj>, and refreshing! my boyfriend's <adj> fav </adj> dish was the <adj> om </adj> gai, which was less spicy but still <adj> super </adj> <adj> aromatic </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj>. portions are <adj> large </adj> and we were stuffed with plenty left over for lunch the <adj> next </adj> day. 

this is definitely the <adj> best </adj> thai food i've had in austin, and i hope they stick around for years to come!
