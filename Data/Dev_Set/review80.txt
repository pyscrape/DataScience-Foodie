i remember i came here one sunday afternoon <adj> last </adj> year during their <adj> first </adj> stages of soft-opening. i was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was going to be a <adj> poke </adj> place <adj> open </adj> in chinatown. 

when my party stepped in, we were treated with nothing but the <adj> highest </adj> form of respect. the owners even took the time to explain what everything was and even brought our orders to our tables for us. i settled for the ahi tuna bowl and it was <adj> delicious </adj>! everything tasted <adj> fresh </adj> and it appeared that they put in a lot of effort into my order. what really hit me was how surprisingly <adj> cheap </adj> everything was. my bowl didn't cost <adj> more </adj> than $12 and i was still satisfied with the quality. what also made this place stand out was the interior of the venue. felt <adj> more </adj> like a cafe than a poke restaurant. there definitely was a <adj> homey </adj> feel to it. 

what really topped off our experience here was that they owner even presented us with a <adj> complimentary </adj> raindrop cake at the end. that was a 
<adj> big </adj> plus! 

<adj> overall </adj> my experience here was <adj> admirable </adj> and i'll definitely be back in the future.
