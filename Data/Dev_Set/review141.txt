the food here was around a 3.5 star, but the ambiance lowered my rating down to a <adj> solid </adj> 3. when you walk in, the restaurant is almost completely <adj> dark </adj>. the lack of lighting makes the meal a bit <adj> gloomy </adj>. 

i had the <adj> soba </adj> noodles with avocado which was actually pretty <adj> damn </adj> <adj> good </adj>. the portion was <adj> massive </adj> and the mushrooms in it were <adj> super </adj> <adj> good </adj>. 

also ordered at the table was the, avocado chicken salad sandwhich and the kale salad with shrimp.
the sandwhich was <adj> good </adj>, nothing to write home about. the kale salad was almost <adj> inedible </adj>. it was probably the <adj> worst </adj> looking salad i've ever seen, plus the lack of shrimp. 

won't be back, but not an <adj> awful </adj> move if you're <adj> close </adj> by.
