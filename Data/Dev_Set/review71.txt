i just want to start by saying, "yes, this place is <adj> over-hyped </adj> right now." however, this doesn't take away from my opinion of the food, service, and <adj> overall </adj> experience. everything we had was <adj> delicious </adj> and for all the reviewers that complained that the portions are <adj> small </adj> - yes, they are...because it's a <adj> tapas </adj> place. between 2 of us we had 4 dishes and were stuffed by the end. 

i'm <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> sure </adj> the reason this place is so <adj> hyped </adj> is because adults are <adj> pretty </adj> much just <adj> giant </adj> children that like to drink out of <adj> fun </adj> receptacles. i would honestly go back for those <adj> fun </adj> "adult capri suns". they're <adj> delicious </adj> too! we got the lemon annie (like a <adj> sweet </adj> lemonade) and the ms. cuteini (<adj> v </adj> refreshing with cucumber and lime)

food: 

- truffle mac & cheese: amazing. cheesy, <adj> warm </adj>, and chewy (there are clams in this dish) with just the <adj> right </adj> amount of truffle 
- kale salad: it was a run of the mill salad to me. apparently there are brussels sprouts in this, but i don't think i got any
- <adj> korean </adj> pancake: very <adj> good </adj> if you like seafood. we ended with this one, but probably should have started with it because it's <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> heavy </adj>. has the consistency of an <adj> eggy </adj> pancake which might put people off.
- chicken: so. <adj> good </adj>. must. try. kinda like the sweeter cousin of <adj> general </adj> tsos

please listen to the reviews that say this place fills up fast - it does and we got there by 6:15 for two of us. by 7:00 the place had racked up at <adj> least </adj> an hour wait - so get there <adj> early </adj> or be prepared to wait.
