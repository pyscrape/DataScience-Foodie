okay <<adj> adj </adj>> i </<adj> adj </adj>> literally was about to just go <<adj> adj </adj>> crazy </<adj> adj </adj>> raving about this place, but immediately to my right, <<adj> adj </adj>> i </<adj> adj </adj>> see another <<adj> adj </adj>> reviewer </<adj> adj </adj>> wrote: "<<adj> adj </adj>> i </<adj> adj </adj>> love this place. right away the customer service was <<adj> adj </adj>> <adj> friendly </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>> and kept blowing me away the <adj> longer </adj> <<adj> adj </adj>> i </<adj> adj </adj>> was there."

yep that's pretty <adj> much </adj> it. all of capitol hill, please come to this <adj> joint </adj> to learn how a <adj> proper </adj> restaurant treats customers! my friend and <adj> i </adj> came here for the <adj> first </adj> time after work. we had mentioned to each <adj> other </adj> that this was our <adj> first </adj> time there; upon hearing us, john (<adj> i </adj> think was his name) immediately had us sample all the poke and the taco salad and pretty <adj> much </adj> whatever else we wanted to sample. he explained all the fish was flown in from hawaii (with the exception of salmon), hence the <adj> fresh </adj>, less <adj> fishy </adj>, but still <adj> melt-in-your-mouth </adj> taste. everything was bomb but we settled on a king bowl (which is <adj> huge </adj> btw and plenty to share for two, maybe even three) topped with tuna and salmon spicy aioli and the <adj> regular </adj> salmon. lots of fixins (<adj> extra </adj> for avocado <adj> i </adj> think). the ladies further down the line were also <adj> super <adj> friendly </adj> </adj> and <adj> welcoming </adj>. we only met them for the <adj> first </adj> time, but by the time we made it to the end of the line, <adj> i </adj> was <adj> ready </adj> to call them my <adj> close </adj> family members. 

after dinner, we were so <adj> stuffed </adj> and didn't have <adj> much </adj> room for dessert, but we wanted to check it out anyway. my friend got a <adj> guava </adj> bubbie but apparently it's <adj> similar </adj> colored to some of the <adj> other </adj> flavors so she was accidentally given a peppermint one. of course the <adj> gracious </adj> man offered her the <adj> correct </adj> one <adj> free </adj> of charge. my lady helping me let me sample the <adj> dole </adj> whip and she even sprinkled <adj> li </adj> hing mui on half of it so i could try it.

oh midway through the meal, another kind lady came and offered <adj> free </adj> miso soup for the customers with some spoons (it was <adj> good </adj>). <adj> i </adj> mean honestly it was just too <adj> much </adj> kindness that <adj> i </adj> didn't know what to do w/ myself.  

i know there are a lot of poke joints popping up around here in <adj> seattle </adj>, but do yourself a <adj> big </adj> ol' favor and check this place out!
