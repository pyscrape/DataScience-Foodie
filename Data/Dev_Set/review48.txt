okay i literally was about to just go <adj> crazy </adj> raving about this place, but immediately to my right, i see another <adj> reviewer </adj> wrote: "i love this place. right away the customer service was <adj> friendly </adj> and kept blowing me away the <adj> longer </adj> i was there."

yep that's pretty much it. all of capitol hill, please come to this <adj> joint </adj> to learn how a <adj> proper </adj> restaurant treats customers! my friend and i came here for the <adj> first </adj> time after work. we had mentioned to each other that this was our <adj> first </adj> time there; upon hearing us, john (i think was his name) immediately had us sample all the poke and the taco salad and pretty much whatever else we wanted to sample. he explained all the fish was flown in from hawaii (with the exception of salmon), hence the <adj> fresh </adj>, less <adj> fishy </adj>, but still <adj> melt-in-your-mouth </adj> taste. everything was bomb but we settled on a king bowl (which is <adj> huge </adj> btw and plenty to share for two, maybe even three) topped with tuna and salmon spicy aioli and the <adj> regular </adj> salmon. lots of fixins (<adj> extra </adj> for avocado i think). the ladies further down the line were also <adj> super <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> welcoming </adj>. we only met them for the <adj> first </adj> time, but by the time we made it to the end of the line, i was <adj> ready </adj> to call them my <adj> close </adj> family members. 

after dinner, we were so <adj> stuffed </adj> and didn't have much room for dessert, but we wanted to check it out anyway. my friend got a <adj> guava </adj> bubbie but apparently it's <adj> similar </adj> colored to some of the other flavors so she was accidentally given a peppermint one. of course the <adj> gracious </adj> man offered her the <adj> correct </adj> one <adj> free </adj> of charge. my lady helping me let me sample the dole whip and she even sprinkled <adj> li </adj> hing mui on half of it so i could try it.

oh midway through the meal, another kind lady came and offered <adj> free </adj> miso soup for the customers with some spoons (it was <adj> good </adj>). i mean honestly it was just too much kindness that i didn't know what to do w/ myself.  

i know there are a lot of poke joints popping up around here in <adj> seattle </adj>, but do yourself a <adj> big </adj> ol' favor and check this place out!
