fyi: bar upfront is cash only

finally came and glad it finally happened. saturday was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 so be <adj> prepared </adj> if you want to come on a weekend. drinks are pretty much adult capri sun's in a bag with alcohol and a <adj> light </adj> cube. ig <adj> worthy </adj>! $9 a bag but worth it. food is <adj> tapas </adj> style so <adj> thy </adj> recommend 2 orders per person which was right. first was the <adj> fried </adj> <adj> soft </adj> shell crab. it was very <adj> crispy </adj> on the <adj> outside </adj> and perfectly cooked in the middle. <adj> great </adj> texture and wasabi sauce added a slightly spicy kick. seafood pancake was not lacking on the seafood nor the flavor. kimchi paella was really <adj> good </adj>. seemed more like risotto cuz it was very <adj> saucy </adj> but i'm not <adj> mad </adj> at that. seafood was <adj> fresh </adj> and not <adj> over-cooked </adj>. <adj> fried </adj> chicken was slightly <adj> sweet </adj> and savory. wish the <adj> outside </adj> was <adj> crispier </adj> and the inside was more <adj> moist </adj> though. finished off with the matcha bread pudding. not much matcha flavor as it seemed to be just topped with matcha powdered sugar but it was very <adj> moist </adj> and not overly <adj> sweet </adj>. i love this place!
