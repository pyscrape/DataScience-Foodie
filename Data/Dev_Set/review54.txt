gopok, gopok, gopok!

with the <adj> recent </adj> influx of <adj> pok </adj> joints in the area, i've been on a mission to try them all. so far, <adj> gopok </adj> wins, thanks to their <adj> generously </adj> cut <adj> fish </adj>, quality, freshness, and marinated flavor.

boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch this afternoon, were <adj> warmly </adj> greeted, and given samples of every pok <adj> available </adj>. our favorites were the spicy tako, <adj> classic </adj> ahi, and the spicy aioli ahi. we <adj> absolutely </adj> loved the fact that everything was <adj> marinated </adj> well, and bursting with <adj> classic </adj> <adj> hawaiian </adj> pok flavors. the <adj> customizable </adj> joints ain't got <adj> nothin </adj>' on this place. throw all the sauces you want on your fish, but you just can't compete with <adj> marinated </adj> pok. 

at $11 for a <adj> regular </adj> (1 pok), $13 for a <adj> large </adj> (2 pok), and $18 for a <adj> king-size </adj> (more pok), bowls are slightly <adj> pricey </adj>, but worth it. we shared a <adj> king-size </adj> bowl, which was generously filled with rice, <adj> classic </adj> & spicy aioli ahi, edamame, krab salad, seaweed salad, masago, pickled ginger, and topped off with <adj> crispy </adj> shallots, garlic, and furikake. since it was a <adj> cold </adj> day, we were also given <adj> complimentary </adj> bowls of miso soup to warm us up, which was a <adj> nice </adj> touch.

family owned and operated, gopok is pretty much pok perfection up in the pnw.
