i think this was my favorite of the dozen or <adj> more </adj> restaurants we dined at this weekend. the list is a 21 and over restaurant so no minors of any kind allowed, which is too <adj> bad </adj> because the kid would love it here.

sunday and monday are all day <adj> happy </adj> hour (half off about half their menu) and $15 bottles of wine!!

we arrived exactly at opening time 5:00 pm <adj> sharp </adj> on sunday and were the <adj> first </adj> to be seated. <adj> good </adj> thing too because the place filled up quickly.

we ordered the gnocchi with truffle sauce, hands down the <adj> best </adj> item on the menu, we got 3 of these! the <adj> best </adj> gnocchi i have ever had, the <adj> perfect </adj> texture and bite along with a <adj> subtle </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj> sauce. order one or three of these for yourself!

meatballs, comes 2 to an order, amazing spicy tomato sauce. balls were <adj> good </adj>

grilled octopus salad, the way that octopus was meant to be made, perfectly grilled with the <adj> right </adj> amount of bite left. simply <adj> seasoned </adj> with salt, pepper, <adj> olive </adj> oil and lemon juice. yummy!

<adj> eggplant </adj> parm with <adj> fresh </adj> mozzarella, <adj> i </adj>'d say one of the weaker fishes, <adj> beautiful </adj> presentation.

clams came in a <adj> clear </adj> briny broth and some  slightly <adj> dense </adj> bread, which works for this fish. very <adj> good </adj>

bacon wrapped prawns were slightly over cooked, would have been <adj> better </adj> if they weren't as <adj> charred </adj> 

<adj> chilean </adj> seabass was a <adj> little </adj> over <adj> seasoned </adj> and i didn't like the grain that they served, just <adj> ok </adj>

service was <adj> impeccable </adj>!

ladies room had a heated toilet seat, kinda psychedelic said a friend.

i'm so <adj> glad </adj> we got a chance to fine here, a <adj> great </adj> experience!
