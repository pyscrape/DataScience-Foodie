i love pasta! and, i love carbs. <adj> il </adj> corvo pasta was the <adj> first </adj> restaurant on my list when i came to visit <adj> seattle </adj> and i'd come here <adj> everyday </adj> for lunch if i could.

got here a <adj> little </adj> bit before noon on a thursday and there was already a line waiting inside the restaurant. i waited for approximately 10 minutes, and luckily found a table right away after i put my <adj> ordered </adj> down and <adj> grabbed </adj> my utensils and a glass of water. i got the papardelle alla bolognese and it just tasted <adj> amazing </adj>. <adj> fresh-homemade </adj> pasta, killer ingredients, <adj> super </adj> appetizing. i <adj> wish </adj> i <adj> ordered </adj> more dishes or tried them all in one seating! the pasta was cooked to <adj> al-dente </adj> perfection and were a <adj> little </adj> chewy, and the sauce was <adj> well-balanced </adj>: thick, <adj> rich </adj>, and <adj> abundant </adj>. and, a <adj> true </adj> bargain for <adj> less </adj> than $10!

the place is a <adj> little </adj> <adj> small </adj> so <adj> please </adj> be <adj> willing </adj> to share a table with other customers if you can! worth the <adj> long </adj> lines? heck yes. <adj> friendly </adj> staff? yes to that too!
