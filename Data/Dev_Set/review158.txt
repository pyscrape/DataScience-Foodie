this was my <adj> first </adj> time at <adj> second </adj> bar - kitchen and <adj> i </adj> really enjoyed it. <adj> i </adj> liked the <adj> inside </adj> decor of the restaurant which was <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> modern </adj>. <adj> i </adj> sat outside this time, but it was still <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> nice </adj>. <adj> i </adj> went on a <adj> friday </adj> afternoon, so it was quite <adj> busy </adj> with a lot of people who work in downtown. service was still <adj> quick </adj> and <adj> good </adj> though. 

<adj> i </adj> got the charcuterie board and <adj> black </adj> and <adj> bleu </adj> pizza and shared it with a friend. the charcuterie board was pretty <adj> good </adj>, <adj> i </adj> especially liked the chicken liver mousse. but <adj> i </adj> feel like <adj> i </adj> was mostly paying for the presentation of it. the <adj> black </adj> and <adj> bleu </adj> pizza was <adj> great </adj>. it had a <adj> good </adj> combination of sweet and salty. it was a bit too oily, but that's a given since it had pork belly on it. 

as we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter for a to go box. he said he'd pack it up and bring it out, but he never brought it out and we waited for awhile to ask him about it. however, we didn't see him and none of the workers seemed to be coming <adj> outside </adj> since we were the <adj> only </adj> ones left <adj> outside </adj>. we didn't want to keep waiting since it was <adj> cold </adj> <adj> outside </adj> and just <adj> left..we </adj> assume he must've just forgotten. but <adj> overall </adj>, i liked it and would come back again.
