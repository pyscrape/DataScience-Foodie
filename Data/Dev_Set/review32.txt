celebrated my 21st birthday here and it was amazing! my girlfriend and <adj> i </adj> went on a <adj> tuesday </adj> night and surprisingly it was really <adj> busy </adj>. the noise level was <adj> above </adj> average and the wait for our food took forever. it was like 30 minute intervals between each course. the portions were ridiculously <adj> small </adj> (but what else do you expect from a <adj> high </adj> end restaurant?), however, the food was <adj> extraordinary </adj>!!! nothing like <adj> i </adj>'ve ever tasted before. as far as drinks, the moscato was <adj> delicious </adj>! <adj> i </adj> also ordered lost lake (cocktail) and <adj> i </adj> felt like it was mostly alcohol with a pinch of juice... <adj> i </adj> only had like 5 sips because it was too <adj> strong </adj> - would never order again. 

everything about canlis is <adj> beautiful </adj>. from the view even to their bathrooms!! service was <adj> exceptional </adj> and i would love to come here again for another <adj> special </adj> occasion :)
