a hella <adj> small </adj> and <adj> intimate </adj> spot. the <adj> whole </adj> restaurant probably seats about 30 people. the tables are <adj> close </adj> together and possibly about 10 bar seats. it was <adj> hard </adj> to find someone to put our name on a <adj> wait </adj> list. finally a staff member helps us, however, i believe she was a server and a hostess. we came for a table of six and it was <adj> difficult </adj> to <adj> wait </adj> for seating because of the <adj> small </adj> location. tip: it's probably a <adj> better </adj> with a table of two to four people.

note: <adj> happy </adj> hour all day sunday and monday. $3.99 for a glass of <adj> red </adj> or <adj> white </adj> (ask yer <adj> bartender </adj>). $15 for a bottle. <adj> happy </adj> hour extends to food or drink.

this spot is a tapas shared plates kinda restaurant, where everything is meant to be shared (probably one plate for <adj> 3-4 </adj> people)

what we ordered:
gnocchi rose
beef shoulder tenderloin steak with fries
grilled octopus salad with <adj> citrus </adj> emulsion -yes must try. tender and so <adj> flavorful </adj>
handmade gnocchi with <adj> black </adj> truffle cream - <adj> good </adj> ordered another
sea salt and pepper calamari - it was ok. <adj> standard </adj> fare with a <adj> garlic </adj> aioli. 
<adj> local </adj> <adj> fresh </adj> clams with <adj> chardonnay </adj> broth and crostini (out of it) boo! we really wanted to try it.
<adj> grilled </adj> chilean sea bass - meh, not too <adj> much </adj> going on 
<adj> wild </adj> mushroom pure soup - so <adj> good </adj> highly recommended
seared ahi  tuna fillet and honey ginger sauce - meh, ahi  was too well <adj> done/dry </adj>.
chicken with mushroom - dry.

between six people... it was <adj> good </adj> except with the inconsistency. our <adj> first </adj> rounds were amazing where when we ordered an encore round, it was really <adj> disappointing </adj>. the drink was not as <adj> good </adj>, octopus was chewy rather than tender. <adj> slight </adj> disappointment there.

ambivalence: you can see the kitchen from the bar area. loved the <adj> red </adj> lighting on the bar.

i'd come back, but probably in a <adj> smaller </adj> group.

parking is street, metered.
