nearly 4 years ago i had my <adj> first </adj> <adj> barley </adj> swine experience. <adj> overall </adj>, it was <adj> positive </adj>. my second was a <adj> few </adj> weeks ago at their <adj> new </adj> location. it did not go all that well. if i didn't already know they have the <adj> same </adj> owner, i would say <adj> barley </adj> swine is a <adj> cheap </adj> knock off of <adj> odd </adj> duck. i adore <adj> odd </adj> duck, deeply. when i'm there i feel home, and everyone there is a <adj> big </adj> reason why. at <adj> barley </adj> swine, i felt like a one night visitor at an <adj> overpriced </adj> motel never to return, and everyone there was a <adj> big </adj> reason why.

the <adj> impeccable </adj> service i recall from the 1st visit was nowhere to be found. gone was the feeling that the staff truly cared and wanted you to enjoy your dining experience. our server was kind of <adj> nice </adj>, but it felt <adj> fake </adj>. <adj> many </adj> of the staff did not look <adj> happy </adj> to be there. the food runners seemed like they were just reciting lines when explaining dishes rather than having any <adj> real </adj> interest or excitement. it took 30 minutes between our <adj> last </adj> two dishes and no one said a thing or checked in on us even once. it's <adj> possible </adj> it was an off night, but i've never experienced such <adj> lackadaisical </adj> and <adj> oblivious </adj> service at <adj> odd </adj> duck.

as for the food, it was strongly suggested to me by a barley expert that i go the tasting menu route over their a la carte option. i failed to heed his advice. perhaps the service and food would have been better, but i would think the service should be on the <adj> same </adj> level regardless. this is what we had:

wagyu rib steak - first, this is not a steak, it was a portion of a steak. to say it's a steak is misleading. the meat itself was <adj> good </adj> albeit with some bites being over salted. we did not like the <adj> baked </adj> beans that accompanied it.

smoked duck - this was pretty <adj> good </adj> and had a comforting flavor to it.

pig skin noodles - i'm a fan of chicharrones, ordering this was a no brainer and i liked the concept. unfortunately, it had very <adj> little </adj> depth. it was pretty much just <adj> hot </adj> sauce with pork skin and i've had much more <adj> flavorful </adj> pork skin and <adj> hot </adj> sauce elsewhere. it also came with <adj> shrimp </adj> dumplings that tasted on the <adj> same </adj> level as ones you can buy from the <adj> frozen </adj> aisle of your grocery store.

shiitake pasta - this dish was really <adj> good </adj> and was our <adj> favorite </adj> despite the <adj> tiny </adj> portion. the <adj> charred </adj> vegetables added a <adj> nice </adj> smoky flavor that balanced well with the acidity of the sauce that was housed within the <adj> delicate </adj> <adj> pillow-y </adj> pasta.

carrots, peanut, ranch, herbs, avocado - this was <adj> odd </adj> <adj> duck-esque </adj>, but not <adj> quite </adj> there. over <adj> salted </adj> and <adj> quite </adj> petite.

the presentation of the dishes was <adj> excellent </adj> yet i have <adj> little </adj> to no interest in eating pretty looking food if it isn't actually <adj> tasty </adj>. we ended up going somewhere else for dessert.

as for the atmosphere/design, it's <adj> similar </adj> to <adj> odd </adj> duck, but not as <adj> self-assured </adj>. it's not <adj> bad </adj>, it's just that the <adj> original </adj> barley had its <adj> own </adj> identity; its <adj> own </adj> charm, its <adj> own </adj> character, and it was <adj> cozier </adj>. i also liked the surrounding <adj> south </adj> lamar feel better. things keep popping up on burnet, but this stretch of it feels like a wasteland currently and i'm also not a fan of any of their strip mall neighbors: bufalina <adj> due </adj> or <adj> lick </adj>.

i got <adj> odd </adj> duck from the moment i walked in the door. me and barley just aren't there and may never be. i'm <adj> ok </adj> with that.

p.s. if you're going to make a reservation, be <adj> aware </adj> that if you need to cancel and you don't cancel 24 hours prior to your reservation you will be charged $25 (for a la carte) to a maximum of $85/person (for tasting menu). perhaps this is a <adj> new </adj> trend some restaurants are doing (<adj> odd </adj> duck doesn't do it), but i haven't come across it elsewhere outside of <adj> nick </adj> kokonas's tock ticketing system.
