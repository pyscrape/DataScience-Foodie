i definitely <adj> agree </adj> with the other reviewers. this place is a <adj> true </adj> gem. i've had <adj> polish </adj> food elsewhere in the city, but it doesn't stack anywhere close to karczma. for its portions and quality, it's <adj> worth </adj> every buck. it's not even that <adj> expensive </adj> too, well within <adj> reasonable </adj> margins.

the plate of <adj> polish </adj> specialities is a <adj> good </adj> place to start for the <adj> uninitiated </adj>. for $13, you can get a <adj> big </adj> plate for <adj> various </adj> assortiments including bigos (hunter's stew), pierogy (the dumplings), <adj> potato </adj> pancakes, and a <adj> kielbasa </adj> sausage. there's also a variety of kebabs for the mains, but my friends regard the pork shoulder as really <adj> good </adj>. per person, each <adj> main </adj> dish should not crack over $15. if you're with a bunch of carnivores, the <adj> grilled </adj> plates for 2 or 3 would be <adj> artery-clogging </adj> heaven. 

i usually order a plate of pierogies even when the plate of <adj> polish </adj> specialities has a <adj> few </adj> of them. but they're so <adj> good </adj> i had to get <adj> more </adj>. i also ordered the lard once. it tastes a <adj> little </adj> exquisite. if you're not too <adj> adventurous </adj> with food, skip the lard and bread. 

servers are really <adj> nice </adj>. they also wear costume, which fits with the decor of the restaurant, supposedly an adaption of a <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> home. <adj> great </adj> <adj> drink </adj> selection, a bunch of <adj> great </adj> beers and there's also some port to close out the night.
