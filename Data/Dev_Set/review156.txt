since this was my <adj> second </adj> visit to <adj> second </adj>, it seems like now would be a <adj> good </adj> time to review it. my <adj> first </adj> visit was a couple of years ago and was during <adj> happy </adj> hour and <adj> i </adj> remember that <adj> i </adj> enjoyed the experience. <adj> i </adj>'m going to focus on my brunch experience, since it is <adj> much </adj> sharper in my mind. 

we arrived <adj> sunday </adj> morning, without a reservation and, though the restaurant was bustling, were <adj> able </adj> to be seated immediately. we opted for a <adj> table </adj> <adj> outside </adj> thanks to austin's <adj> mild </adj> december weather and a <adj> sunny </adj> day of 65 degrees. we were served a <adj> carafe </adj> and two glasses of water within moments. our server stopped by shortly <adj> thereafter </adj> to greet us and answer any questions. 

the food:

<adj> cauliflower </adj> soup:  amazingly <adj> good </adj>!  creamy in texture and flavor, dressed with <adj> toasted </adj> cashews and roasted <adj> cauliflower </adj> pieces and drizzled with a <adj> little </adj> oil. seriously, the <adj> best </adj> version of this i've had. 

crispy <adj> french </adj> <adj> toast </adj> with a <adj> seared </adj> <adj> foie </adj> add-on:  the <adj> toast </adj> part was a <adj> little </adj> mushy in texture and though it was cooked, the texture made it seem <adj> undercooked </adj>. it was served with some strawberries and a side of butter and syrup, but was <adj> sweet </adj> enough to not need <adj> additional </adj> sugar. the <adj> seared </adj> <adj> foie </adj> was really the <adj> best </adj> part and since i refer to it as meat butter, i didn't really need to add butter to the dish. it was a <adj> lovely </adj> <adj> sweet </adj> and <adj> savory </adj> combination. 

home fries: not fries. more like skillet potatoes, but amazingly <adj> good </adj>. <adj> crisp/soft </adj> <adj> new </adj> potatoes that have been smashed slightly and covered in jalapeos, onions and cilantro or was it parsley?  anyway, they were the tits. loved them!

<adj> texas </adj> benedict:  the <adj> perfect </adj> blend. pulled pork, poached eggs, chorizo <adj> gravy </adj> and jalapeo <adj> cheese </adj> biscuits. oh my goodness. this was my daughter's plate, but we switched plates <adj> mid </adj> meal, so <adj> i </adj> was <adj> lucky </adj> enough to try it. divine!  the <adj> only </adj> minor, <adj> tiny </adj>, <adj> baby </adj> complaint was that the biscuits were a <adj> little </adj> <adj> denser/drier </adj> than <adj> i </adj>'d like, but that did allow them to hold up to the <adj> gravy </adj> better. 

the service was <adj> good </adj>. water glasses were filled before they were <adj> empty </adj>. our server checked back on us a couple of times. the manager also came by to <adj> glad </adj> hand. <adj> great </adj> experience over all.
