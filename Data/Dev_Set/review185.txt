for a 1.5 hour wait in the freezing <adj> cold </adj> outside, i expected my mind to be blown. the line was down the block around 12:30 on a friday, and we thought it must be <adj> good </adj>! they only serve three pastas a day, at $9 each. the day we went the menu had pappardelle <adj> bolognese </adj>, <adj> pasta </adj> mista (had goat cheese) and <adj> baked </adj> mafalda. we ordered one of each and an <adj> extra </adj> pappardelle because it's one of my <adj> favorite </adj> pastas. the pappardelle was the most <adj> disappointing </adj>. the sauce was incredibly salty and the <adj> pasta </adj> was <adj> raw </adj> in the center. the <adj> baked </adj> mafalda was not too <adj> bad </adj>, it had loads of veggies in it and was very <adj> soft </adj>. the <adj> pasta </adj> mista was the <adj> best </adj> of the bunch. i expected not to like it because i'm not a fan of goat cheese, but it tasted like <adj> regular </adj> cheese. 

tl;dr: not worth the wait. and there are definitely better <adj> pasta </adj> places (but with a <adj> bigger </adj> price tag).
