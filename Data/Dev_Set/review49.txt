everyone is always so <adj> friendly </adj> here and <adj> willing </adj> to do things your way. one thing i really like about the 45th stop n shop is you automatically get rice and lettuce in your bowl unless you ask differently can't remember if <adj> brown </adj> rice is an option there, but it is here! i ask if i could get part <adj> brown </adj> rice and part lettuce in my bowl with the rice on the bottom so the poke wouldn't be sitting on <adj> hot </adj> rice they were <adj> happy </adj> to oblige. i don't like a lot of the extras i don't feel that just because it's included it's needed i had the <adj> classic </adj> ahi with ginger, seaweed <adj> salad </adj> and cucumber. had been craving poke all week this so hit the spot. also grabbed a couple of desserts as a thank you to some girls at work. love the <adj> dole </adj> whip floats! <adj> best </adj> part is it's <adj> dairy </adj> <adj> free </adj> and who can  say no to li hing?
