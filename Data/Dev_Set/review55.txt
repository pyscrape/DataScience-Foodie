alright. this place is by far the <adj> best </adj> poke place in seattle. <adj> daily </adj> shipment of tuna from hawaii to seattle? <adj> freshly </adj> cut and marinated for our mouths? what <adj> more </adj> can you ask. i was surprised by the texture of the tuna. i don't think i've ever had this kind of <adj> fresh </adj> tuna in my life. i guess the rest of the tuna places i go to, may that be <adj> musashi </adj> or other <adj> sushi </adj> place around town, that their tuna is previously <adj> frozen </adj>, but this place is dope. <adj> side </adj> note, salmon is from vancouver, bc. 

my two friends and i got the king size of two proteins, with gopoke spicy ahi and spicy aloli salmon, and it fed us all for $<adj> 18-t/t </adj>. man, they give you so much fish! we had all the toppings we could get in our bowl. we also got their dole whip, and that was really <adj> good </adj>. very <adj> similar </adj> to the dole plantation from hawaii. 

will be back for <adj> more </adj> poke. prices vary from $11-15 for <adj> individual </adj> sizes, and king size is $5 <adj> more </adj>. i won't be surprised if the prices go up once they are <adj> more </adj> <adj> established </adj>.
