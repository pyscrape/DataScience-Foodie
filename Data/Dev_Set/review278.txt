oh fk yeah.


is the <adj> only </adj> phrase i can describe kichin. it's been quite <adj> awhile </adj> since i got excited about food. now i waltzed my way in here after a <adj> happy </adj> hour so my memory/feeling of the food might be <adj> superfluous </adj>. i blame the one too <adj> many </adj> <adj> brooklyn </adj> lagers i've had.

it's been <adj> awhile </adj> since i've seen employees actually give a shit about their food. i ordered the spicy salmon nigiri (rice ball). my spicy salmon rice ball was handcrafted with such love and care. the <adj> amazing </adj> man (<adj> god </adj> bless him) made my onigiri in <adj> less </adj> than 45 seconds, inspected it and then wrapped it so perfectly. the man in the front of house lovingly poured some <adj> amazing </adj> <adj> red </adj> sauce in a cup to go as well. this is the type of joint where you take your shit to go and make your way home so you can stuff your face like an animal. seating is <adj> present </adj> but very <adj> limited </adj>. my spicy salmon rice ball was <adj> cooked </adj> perfectly and stuffed with <adj> soooo </adj> much salmon. perfectly <adj> cooked </adj> salmon. the fish was <adj> moist </adj> and <adj> delicate </adj>. the way salmon should always be <adj> cooked </adj>. it was spicy but in a <adj> flavorful </adj> manner. not overpowering. very <adj> filling </adj>.  

words cannot explain the happiness i feel from eating their food. i am so <adj> happy </adj> i <adj> only </adj> live 3 blocks away from <adj> kichin </adj>. now if they delivered, half my paycheck would probably go to eating here. my <adj> only </adj> regret is that i <adj> only </adj> ordered a spicy salmon rice onigiri and i wish i was <adj> hungrier </adj> and tried <adj> more </adj> stuff.
