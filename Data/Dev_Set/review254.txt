<adj> i </adj>'m a sucker for <adj> fancy </adj> bars and <adj> outdoor </adj> seating.  we came in 10 minutes before the kitchen closed and they still took our orders!  <adj> i </adj> was very <adj> impressed </adj> as <adj> i </adj> was <adj> sure </adj> they were going to turn us away.  what <adj> i </adj> appreciated and enjoyed the most was the quality of their dishes,  even though my drink wasn't some <adj> alcoholic </adj> cocktail concoction, they still gave me a very <adj> unique </adj> experience.  <adj> i </adj> had a soda and shrub blackberry drink, which used vinegar to preserve the berry,, something to that nature that was something <adj> i </adj> never had before, and it was so <adj> cool </adj>.  with my non-<adj> alcoholic </adj> drink <adj> i </adj> was still feeling pretty <adj> fresh </adj> and <adj> fancy </adj>, as the drink was just so <adj> unique </adj> and presented beautifuly.

now onto the <adj> actual </adj> food.  we ordered the boar meatballs, grilled beef skewers, and the pan seared salmon.  the boar meatball was <adj> skippable </adj>, the sauce kind of tastes like hoisin sauce and the bread served with it was a bit <adj> strange </adj>.  the <adj> other </adj> dishes were <adj> great </adj>, however in a <adj> surprising </adj> manner.  i actually enjoyed the salad mixes <adj> more </adj> than the meat options itself!  the salads were just so perfectly <adj> mixed </adj>, that gave me an assortment of flavors i had to keep going back for.  it was a <adj> strange </adj> experience as the meat is usually the spotlight but man, that <adj> black </adj> eye pea salad i could go back for.  

i had a really <adj> great </adj> time here, but not too <adj> much </adj> else on the menu i want to check out.  <adj> great </adj> place if youre looking for somewhere <adj> more </adj> <adj> intimate </adj> and relaxing on broadway.
