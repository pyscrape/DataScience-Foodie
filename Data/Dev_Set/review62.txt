thursday kitchen is <adj> okay </adj>. just <adj> okay </adj>. went with some girlfriends for a catch up dinner & drinks. 

a <adj> few </adj> comments:
- ambience: it's <adj> cute </adj>, with <adj> low </adj> lighting, and is in the <adj> basement </adj> space of a building. it's a bit more <adj> cramped </adj> than other restaurants, even in nyc and the les specifically. our table was basically suited for one person, but had three seats - the <adj> unlucky </adj> <adj> third </adj> had to sit between our table and the one <adj> next </adj> to us making for an <adj> awkward </adj> seating arrangement for all involved. 
- wait: we waited about 2 hours on a friday. not <adj> unexpected </adj>, so doesn't impact my rating here.
- service: service was <adj> odd </adj>. no one seemed particularly <adj> interested </adj> in the food they were serving, or creating a <adj> good </adj> experience for diners. read below my comment on the "gnocchi" dish. 

what we had, and notes <adj> specific </adj> to each item:

- avocado - creme fraiche was <adj> overwhelming </adj>, and gave the dish an <adj> incredibly </adj> <adj> creamy </adj> consistency overall. the flavor was <adj> good </adj>, but the texture took away from the freshness of the <adj> raw </adj> avocado in my opinion.
- truffle mac and <adj> cheese </adj> - <adj> limited </adj> flavor of truffles here. it was our "<adj> favorite </adj>" item, but who doesn't love <adj> cheese </adj> and pasta? would have expected a very <adj> strong </adj> truffle flavor. 
- soft shell crab - well <adj> prepared </adj>, no complaints here other than this dish is a <adj> little </adj> <adj> difficult </adj> to share.
- gnocchi - definitely had the most <adj> korean </adj> flavors of all of the dishes. however, our waiter did not tell us to mix the <adj> garlic </adj> aioli into the gojuchang sauce, so it made for a <adj> strange </adj> <adj> eating </adj> experience. a waiter told us at the very end that we hadn't eaten it correctly, but provided no remedy for "our" mistake. this probably frustrated me the most.
- pure jeremy (drink) - both drinks were <adj> delicious </adj>, and loved the concept in the bags. although not <adj> unique </adj> to thursday kitchen, it was definitely <adj> cute </adj>. 
- ms. cutetini (drink) - <adj> same </adj> comment as above.

<adj> overall </adj>, i wouldn't go back here except to grab a <adj> quick </adj> drink from the bar. the food is nowhere close to the quality or flavor of other <adj> korean </adj> restaurants, and the dishes just aren't <adj> interesting </adj> enough for me to justify how far it strays.
