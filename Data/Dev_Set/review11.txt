dee dee is not only serving up some of the <adj> best </adj> trailer food i have tasted, lakana and justin are making some of the <adj> best </adj> thai food i have tasted. the duo are both incredibly talented and kind. 

first things first, this food trailer park is both <adj> pup </adj> friendly and byob. during our visit we tried the following:

moo ping - choice of 2 or 5 perfectly marinated pork skewers with a side of <adj> delicious </adj> <adj> sticky </adj> rice and spicy tangy  fish  sauce. i loved everything i tried but the moo ping was my <adj> absolute </adj> favorite!

larb  moo - the larbmoo is bursting with <adj> amazing </adj> flavors! this <adj> dish </adj> has spicy minced pork with <adj> thai </adj> basil, lime, cucumber slices, cilantro and rice. bonus eating this <adj> dish </adj> with your hands is encouraged.

pad kapow - i  hardy  portion of stir <adj> fried </adj> pork, <adj> thai </adj> basil with a <adj> delightful </adj> jasmine rice, <adj> cold </adj> cucumber and topped with a <adj> fried </adj> egg. 

<adj> sticky </adj> mango - we ended things on a pleasantly <adj> sweet </adj> note! this <adj> traditional </adj> thai dessert has slices of <adj> luscious </adj> mango on top of rice with <adj> sweet </adj> coconut milk dressing.
