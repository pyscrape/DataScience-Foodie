a <adj> good </adj> friend of ours chose this spot for a catch up dinner and it has the <adj> perfect </adj> ambiance for that. it felt <adj> warm </adj> and <adj> cozy </adj> with a woodsy feel to it. <adj> overall </adj>, we had a <adj> great </adj> time with <adj> good </adj> food. i remember enjoying the <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage and potato pierogies the most. i'd recommend this place and come again if friends were looking for a <adj> polish </adj> spot.
