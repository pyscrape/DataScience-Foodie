this is one of the places i wanted to love but was underwhelmed. the place is <adj> super </adj> cute, and it was mentioned as one of the <adj> best </adj> <adj> new </adj> restaurants in austin by bon <adj> appetite </adj> magazine. 

my bf and i were walk-ins, they didn't appear <adj> busy </adj> but were catering to resos made prior, so our only option was to sit at the <adj> high </adj>-top </adj> tables by the bar, no <adj> big </adj> deal. however, i was <adj> super </adj> bummed when the hostess told us we wouldn't be <adj> able </adj> to have the <adj> dim </adj> sum cart roll by our table bc it may get in the way near the front entrance, and the height difference between the cart and <adj> high </adj> tops would be "<adj> awkward </adj>". imo, sitting at the <adj> high </adj>-tops would give you the <adj> perfect </adj> bird eye view of the <adj> dim </adj> sum cart! also i felt having the <adj> dim </adj> sum cart at emmer & rye is half the experience! i felt we weren't part of the <adj> true </adj> emmer & rye dining experience. i feel like management should make the <adj> dim </adj> sum cart work in all areas of the restaurant, probably would've ordered more <adj> dim </adj> sum if we could see it. (note: although we couldn't <adj> dim </adj> sum cart service, we were still <adj> able </adj> to order from the <adj> dim </adj> sum menu) 

from my understanding the menu rotates, but nothing stood out to me. the food was <adj> ok </adj>, nothing blew me away. i think we ordered 6 plates <adj> total </adj>. the <adj> spaghetti </adj> pasta was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> undercooked </adj> and you maybe got <adj> 3-4 </adj> bites out of it for $16. the desert was <adj> ok </adj> too. my cocktail was <adj> small </adj>, maybe 4oz. my <adj> bf </adj> spent a lot of money here for the two of us and we were still <adj> hungry </adj>. treated him to banger's shortly after. 

for being named one of the <adj> best </adj> <adj> new </adj> restaurants from a <adj> prestigious </adj> magazine, i was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> disappointed </adj>. i do want to come back, but i'll be <adj> sure </adj> to come when the menu stands out to me. i also hear <adj> brunch </adj> servings are <adj> larger </adj> than dinner so, gotta try that too.
