was in the area during hh and decided to finally try out this place with the hubs.  it was about 530pm and we scored some <adj> decent </adj> parking.  it was impressively <adj> busy </adj> at the peak of hh.  this place is very <adj> small </adj> and parking is <adj> difficult </adj>, but worth it if your wait is not long.  we got the <adj> last </adj> two topper table <adj> available </adj> luckily.  the <adj> sole </adj> server knew it was our <adj> first </adj> time since i asked her if we could order hh from the <adj> regular </adj> non bar seating area (yes, you can).  we were promptly seated by her, given menus to browse, and bread from <adj> macrina </adj> bakery (at <adj> least </adj> that's what the menu said their bread was from!).

we both got <adj> hh </adj> drinks - myself a <adj> red </adj> wine blend from italy and the hubs got <adj> peroni </adj> pilsner beer.  we ordered the spicy meatballs, <adj> truffle </adj> oil gnocchi, and <adj> chilean </adj> sea bass.  the meatballs were <adj> huge </adj> and came with two <adj> huge </adj> meatballs with a <adj> good </adj> kick to it.  i wish the meat was grounded down finer but it's certainly not your <adj> typical </adj> single ground beef type either.  the leftover sauce tastes <adj> good </adj> when you use the bread to get all the sauce from the plate!  the <adj> truffle </adj> oil gnocchi was my <adj> favorite </adj>!  the very <adj> creamy </adj> <adj> truffle </adj> oil sauce was heavenly coating the handmade gnocchi pieces.  the gnocchi pieces were <adj> small </adj> and <adj> easy </adj> to eat and offered the <adj> perfect </adj> gnocchi to cream sauce ratio.  every bite was <adj> delicious </adj>!  the <adj> chilean </adj> sea bass also pretty <adj> great </adj>!  i was most <adj> impressed </adj> by the fact that it was particularly <adj> hot </adj> when served (not just <adj> warm </adj> ish... it tasted like it just got taken off the <adj> hot </adj> pan!) and over a bed of grains- barley i think.  

i thought we would have ordered <adj> more </adj> but we were pretty <adj> full </adj> after the three dishes we shared and one drink each.  the dishes are that <adj> big </adj> but three dishes for two people was just enough.  our server, kim a. ??, was so <adj> great </adj>!  she was <adj> spunky </adj> and <adj> super </adj> cute.  she was a <adj> great </adj> seller trying to get us to drink <adj> more </adj> or order <adj> more </adj> food, but it was not over bearing at all.  i actually did want to order <adj> more </adj> just because she was so <adj> persuading </adj>!  but my hubs doesn't act on emotions like i do, he said no simply bc he was <adj> full </adj>. haha she was the only server for the <adj> whole </adj> place, which is not <adj> big </adj>, but she <adj> worked </adj> that room on point!  never did i feel neglected, never were our water cups empty (shout out to the bus boy on that though!), never did we get a <adj> tired </adj> grin from an over <adj> worked </adj> server, service was on point and the food was <adj> delicious </adj>!  i am waiting to go back!!
