oops... coming from sf, where <adj> fine </adj> dining doesn't necessarily mean <adj> fine </adj> attire, we did not realize there was a dress code at canlis. to our relief and gratefulness, we were not looked down upon (at <adj> least </adj> not to our faces!) for our "jeans and t-shirt" attire, but my boyfriend was asked to wear one of the sport coats they had in the back. 

service continued to be <adj> friendly </adj> throughout the meal, but it was slightly <adj> inconsistent </adj> with the <adj> bread </adj> (my boyfriend was offered <adj> more </adj> <adj> bread </adj> twice, each time saying yes, but it was not brought out until well after his <adj> second </adj> yes. i, on the <adj> other </adj> hand, finished mine before my entree and was never offered another).

the drinks: 

almost <adj> perfect </adj> cocktail - lives up to its name, tastes like the <adj> best </adj> manhattan you've ever had.

velvet jumpsuit (raspberry, tarragon, orange, and <adj> pok </adj> <adj> pok </adj> apple vinegar) - very <adj> good </adj> and <adj> tangy </adj>, carbonated and refreshing. <adj> non </adj> <adj> alcoholic </adj>.

the food:

the <adj> aforementioned </adj> bread is football <adj> shaped </adj> and kind of weirdly pokey on both ends. served <adj> warm </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>.

you have a choice of three or four courses, or a seven course tasting menu. we chose to have 

canlis salad with bacon, cherry tomatoes, croutons - a <adj> classic </adj>, highlighted with a <adj> bright </adj> dressing that tasted <adj> fresh </adj>. cool to taste this in person after hearing raves on canlis's episode of <adj> top </adj> chef's <adj> seattle </adj> season.

barley porridge with geoduck and sorrels - the geoduck was <adj> tasty </adj> but that was the only <adj> good </adj> part of it. the barley was <adj> super </adj> sour for me. luckily, my boyfriend liked this well enough.

butter poached <adj> shrimp </adj> - melted in my mouth and had a meaty flavor.

dungeness crab with bok choy - the bok choy was draped over the crab in presentation, and the taste mimicked that. the crab flavor was very <adj> masked </adj>.

dry aged duck with beet mol and beets - this dish was <adj> incredible </adj>, with a sweet, <adj> strong </adj> duck taste.

filet mignon - cooked perfectly, but sadly the spinach pure was grossly oversalted. the morels and <adj> cippolini </adj> onions were just <adj> fine </adj> but not <adj> plentiful </adj> enough.

it seemed like the palate at canlis generally steers toward the <adj> sour </adj> and/or <adj> salty </adj> flavors. nothing was underseasoned, for <adj> sure </adj>.

dessert:

pour over coffee was <adj> tasty </adj>.

souffl - eggy and pillowy just as a souffl should be. stood <adj> tall </adj> and <adj> perfect </adj>. they added the crime anglaise table side.

"cake" hazelnut sponge cake, raspberry granita, <adj> elderflower </adj> mousse - this was <adj> incredible </adj> and an out of the box that shows canlis's <adj> modern </adj> side. the sponge was so crumbly, not really like a cake but it tasted like one.

the standouts here are the service, the <adj> amazing </adj> view of lake union, the entrees and desserts.

they close out the meal with <adj> earl </adj> <adj> gray </adj> and <adj> dark </adj> chocolate and smores macarons, which were all <adj> forgettable </adj>. however, they send you home with one of the most <adj> amazing </adj> things of all - a <adj> simple </adj>, <adj> coconut-filled </adj> chocolate bar that tastes like an <adj> elevated </adj> mounds bar.
