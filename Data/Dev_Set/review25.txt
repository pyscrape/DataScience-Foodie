my experience here was awesome from start to finish! i don't usually go to fine dining restaurants like this, so my opinion may be <adj> different </adj> from others who normally go to places like this.  but we drove up, the valet people opened all the car doors and we walked inside. we were greted immediately by the host who also took our jackets and found us a place to sit.  we did not have a reservation so we sat near the bar and the service was <adj> excellent </adj>.  luckily they were <adj> able </adj> to seat us at some tables next to the bar.  our waitress was extremely <adj> curteous </adj> and polite the entire night. they made <adj> sure </adj> our water glasses were <adj> full </adj> at all times and when they saw our <adj> empty </adj> drink glasses, they asked if we wanted another. 

the food was <adj> delicious </adj>. i had the three course meal and started off with the salad. my entree was the pork dish and for dessert i had the creme brulee. i also had a side of truffle fries. eveeything was <adj> excelllent </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj>.  everyone had their plates served at the <adj> same </adj> time. before we were served dinner, we got cider and a <adj> little </adj> pastry, which were both <adj> delicious </adj>! at the end of our meal we also got <adj> mini </adj> macarons, which were also so <adj> good </adj>. i mean everything was just so <adj> good </adj>. 

i was <adj> sad </adj> to have the <adj> meal </adj> end.  they did not rush us out the door after they brought us the check.  we made our way out and the host who took our jackets when we walked in was <adj> able </adj> to remember which ones belonged to us and helped us put them on.  that was <adj> impressive </adj>. <adj> right </adj> when we walked out the door, the valet pulled up with our car and it was even already <adj> warm </adj>.  i was also impressed by that.  we didn't have to stand and wait. we just walked out of the restaurant and got <adj> right </adj> into our <adj> warm </adj> car (it was probably 25 or so that night) and left. 

definitely an <adj> amazing </adj> experience from start to finish. everything was <adj> great </adj>. the food, the servers, everything. loved it!
