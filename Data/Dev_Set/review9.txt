finally!!! it's been 4 <adj> long </adj> years i've lived in austin with not <adj> good </adj> to just ok thai food. thai food is easily one of my <adj> favorite </adj> cuisines, but it's one i have not enjoyed while living here #1stworldproblems. thanks to justin and lakana (the super <adj> sweet </adj> couple behind this food truck) there is now <adj> legit </adj> <adj> real </adj> thai food here in austin!

tried the moo ping (pork skewers), <adj> pad </adj> ka pow (<adj> mint </adj> pork as my peeps in la would call it), <adj> som </adj> tum (<adj> papaya </adj> salad), mango with <adj> sticky </adj> rice, and their home brewed thai <adj> iced </adj> tea. all were on point bursting with a <adj> full </adj> depth of flavor and <adj> wonderful </adj> textures. this, my <adj> dear </adj> friends, is what thai food should taste like. their <adj> sticky </adj> rice is exactly how it ought to be too where you can eat it with your hands like bread.

<adj> many </adj> complain about the <adj> continued </adj> influx of people moving to austin. no doubt there are downsides, but <adj> few </adj> note the <adj> good </adj> that comes with it. an increase in diversity and a demand for <adj> better </adj> food are two positives and dee dee is a <adj> clear </adj> example of this.

justin and lakana, thank you for bringing <adj> awesome </adj> thai food to austin. you have a <adj> new </adj> regular now along with everyone else i plan on singing your praises to!

p.s. <adj> special </adj> thanks to jack c. who i first heard of dee dee from.
