this is definitely not your <adj> typical </adj> thai place, and you won't find your <adj> usual </adj> pad thai or <adj> colorful </adj> curries on their menu. instead, you get <adj> stir </adj> fries loaded with flavor from a variety of <adj> authentic </adj> thai spices and ingredients. i went on a really <adj> warm </adj> afternoon, so starting off with a thai <adj> iced </adj> tea definitely hit the spot. also, it was pretty <adj> busy </adj>, and since the two owners take all the orders and do all the cooking, it took a bit of while for the orders to come. <adj> good </adj> food takes time, so i didn't mind the wait. but be prepared in case you're looking for something quick.

my friend and i went with the pad ka pow and <adj> tofu </adj> stir-fry (the om gai  and <adj> few </adj> <adj> other </adj> items were <adj> unavailable </adj>). i don't have the <adj> highest </adj> spice tolerance, so the pad ka pow definitely got the sweat and sniffles going, especially since it was about 95 degrees outside. the basil and cucumber slices helped, but i could only get about halfway through the order before waving the <adj> white </adj> flag. the <adj> tofu </adj> was much milder and came with a <adj> beautiful </adj> variety of <adj> fresh </adj> veggies, which exemplifies the pride and effort they put into preparing their food. i do wish they had a <adj> few </adj> <adj> additional </adj> menu items, especially since some things were sold out or <adj> unavailable </adj> when i visited, but i do look forward to coming back.
