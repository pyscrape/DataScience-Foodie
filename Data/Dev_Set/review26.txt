<adj> top </adj> dollar for a <adj> top </adj> dollar experience. the service was incredibly accommodating and <adj> attentive </adj>, as expected for a <adj> fine </adj> dining experience. though reservations were all <adj> full </adj> and booked through january, they were <adj> able </adj> to seat us in the lounge, and while we could not get the <adj> amazing </adj> view <adj> most </adj> people are probably trying to get, we were seated <adj> next </adj> to the <adj> charming </adj> pianist (<adj> jason </adj> lux) who really made our experience <adj> special </adj>. he not only conversed with us, but he also allowed for us to make several recommendations with an ability to play music spanning <adj> many </adj> <adj> different </adj> genres and styles. 

the food was <adj> incredible </adj>. my table agreed that the plate of the night was definitely the <adj> dry-aged </adj> duck, and it was most definitely the <adj> best </adj> duck i have ever had. we also had the pork and <adj> wagyu </adj> <adj> new </adj> york strip which were both <adj> delicious </adj>. the <adj> favorite </adj> appetizer was the dungeness crab, but the oysters, steak tartare, and <adj> foie </adj> gras were also really <adj> tasty </adj>. as far as dessert goes, the banana mousse was my <adj> favorite </adj>, and while the <adj> japanese </adj> cheesecake and the sorbet were both <adj> tasty </adj>, they weren't really that <adj> special </adj> (at <adj> least </adj> not for the price tag of the <adj> overall </adj> experience). getting the three course option was <adj> enough </adj> to make me <adj> full </adj>, just right .
