disclaimer. i'm a tad tipsy but i wanted to write this now before i forget all the <adj> great </adj> things we had!  so <adj> bear </adj> with me as we ride this train!

drinks - wonderful! i had about four rounds of la recolte. so. <adj> good </adj>. it was <adj> sweet </adj>, but not too <adj> sweet </adj>, and it made me wanting coming back for more. get it if you like <adj> pear </adj>! (not the <adj> shitty </adj> <adj> fake </adj> <adj> pear </adj> flavored candy or drinks... this was <adj> legit </adj>). 

my partner had 3 drinks, ranked from <adj> least </adj> to <adj> best </adj>: "1789" - it was <adj> good </adj>, it tasted <adj> smokey </adj> and <adj> sweet </adj>, if you're into that sort of thing. highlight was the chili salt rim. <adj> second </adj> <adj> best </adj> was "l'aviateur," which you shouldn't be fooled by the color - it's really <adj> good </adj> in an <adj> interesting </adj> way. it was <adj> sweet </adj>, but <adj> floral </adj>, but not overpowering. make <adj> sure </adj> to eat the cherry at the end! it ain't no maraschino cherry! and the <adj> best </adj> drink, the "<adj> french </adj> 75." it was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> sweet </adj> but not too <adj> sweet </adj>. <adj> super </adj> refreshing! 

and now, the food. 

burrata salad - they did not skimp on the burrata at all! the arugula was dressed nicely. it's <adj> super </adj> <adj> important </adj> to get all the elements in the salad in each bite. 

brussels sprouts - sauted perfectly! not overcooked, and it had a <adj> nice </adj> char on them. works well with the almonds, pomegranate seeds and <adj> dried </adj> cranberries. 

seared tuna - almost <adj> typical </adj> - the pepper crust was <adj> great </adj>! temperature was <adj> good </adj>, and i liked the <adj> israeli </adj> <adj> couscous </adj> it came with. not <adj> sure </adj> if <adj> israeli </adj> <adj> couscous </adj>, <adj> pesto </adj> and seared tuna go together, but it was <adj> delicious </adj> nonetheless. 

scallop carpaccio - salmon caviar was <adj> delicious </adj>! it was everything that we needed. it's <adj> super </adj> light, so it might be best as a starter to your meal. the server asked us if we needed bread with it, and i obviously said yes, not knowing what i was in for. turns out, there's a lot of <adj> olive </adj> oil in the dish, which is <adj> good </adj> for the bread. but the <adj> scallops </adj> themselves do not need bread. try to eat this dish without others that will overpower this one! 

duck confit - when it's served, it looks like a lot! don't mind (or eat) the blades of grass - they're not chives. we learned the <adj> hard </adj> way. it was just <adj> delicious </adj>. with the <adj> truffle </adj> pure on top, and the potato, it's like a <adj> savory </adj> cake. you just have to try it yourself. 

after a <adj> few </adj> rounds of <adj> delicious </adj> <adj> varied </adj> beverages, we thought we were done. boy were we <adj> wrong </adj>! the <adj> wait </adj> staff insisted that we have dessert. we were <adj> full </adj> and <adj> i </adj> thought <adj> i </adj> couldn't stomach any <adj> more </adj>. (pun intended.) the host was a <adj> tiny </adj> bit <adj> upset </adj> that we didn't order a crepe and just ordered one for us! he strongly suggested the lemon sugar crepe. it magically appeared in front of us after we paid our check. popping sugar drizzled on top?! come on!!! not too <adj> sweet </adj>. loved it. it was like <adj> i </adj> was eating breakfast. 

if <adj> i </adj> come back to this area again <adj> i </adj>'m definitely going back. the staff are wayyyy too <adj> nice </adj> and accommodating! drinks are so <adj> diverse </adj> and <adj> innovative </adj>!
