pappardelle alla bolognese was <adj> sheer </adj> delight! it was slightly spicy. not overly sauced. the pasta was perfectly <adj> al </adj> dente. with my glass of house <adj> red </adj> and <adj> focaccia </adj> bread... wowza!

it's a <adj> true </adj> bargain at $9 a plate when you consider it's all house made. this is the <adj> worst </adj> kept secret in town. and i love it!
