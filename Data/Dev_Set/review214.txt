here's what made me a fan: the food. the service. the <adj> after-dinner </adj> conversation with chef fink. he did a <adj> crawfish </adj> dish so <adj> sublime </adj>, i was compelled to order another one immediately. and i seriously thought for a moment this restaurant was somehow designed by volvo - all <adj> simple </adj> lines within <adj> elegant </adj> minimalism. 

here's what made me tilt my head askew, like your dog sensing its <adj> first </adj> poltergeist: you're encouraged to order 2-3 <adj> small </adj> plates per person from the menu, which i get. but after you do that, they'll start your <adj> push-cart </adj> service, where a <adj> different </adj> server brings <adj> 4-5 </adj> <adj> off-menu </adj> <adj> small </adj> plates to your table. you pick & choose whatever you want, and whatever you select is added to your bill. <adj> 15-20 </adj> minutes later, the cart comes around again, with <adj> new </adj> & <adj> different </adj> dishes. and <adj> 15-20 </adj> minutes later, it's back. here's the dilemma:

1. yeah, <adj> i </adj> get the dim sum connection, but we're talking <adj> substantial </adj> <adj> small </adj> plates here, not a trio of <adj> tiny </adj> wontons you can gulp without blinking. 
2. <adj> i </adj> kept wondering how these <adj> random </adj> cart selections would disrupt the flow & timing of our <adj> original </adj> menu choices. <adj> i </adj> know that's not my problem. 
3. it's <adj> hard </adj> to resist trying all the dishes from each cart pass. the presentations are <adj> remarkable </adj>. but it would have been way too <adj> much </adj> food. 
4. <adj> i </adj> kept thinking, should <adj> i </adj> have picked that <adj> other </adj> plate instead of this one? gosh darn it, did <adj> i </adj> just sabotage the <adj> entire </adj> experience? if <adj> i </adj>'m not totally <adj> blown </adj> away, isn't it actually my fault? 
5. i wasn't <adj> sure </adj> if i was supposed to tip the cart server separately from our <adj> table </adj> server. both <adj> erin </adj> & <adj> marsha </adj> spent quality time explaining every dish to us. i wound up leaving one <adj> big </adj> tip on my bill. hope that worked. 

the <adj> bottom </adj> line is <adj> restaurant </adj> time is my <adj> lazy </adj> time, and <adj> i </adj> don't want to have to think about what <adj> i </adj>'m doing. especially at a <adj> fine </adj> dining establishment. <adj> i </adj> just want to be impressed. for my <adj> next </adj> emmer & rye visit, <adj> i </adj>'m going to sit at the counter facing the <adj> open </adj> kitchen, and politely ask: "can y'all just make me your <adj> favorite </adj> dozen dishes?" won't even question what they'll be, because <adj> i </adj> bet they'll all be <adj> great </adj>. 

<adj> final </adj> notes: don't even come here without resos, this place is a <adj> current </adj> <adj> top-five </adj> austin restaurant destination, and that's not going to change soon. silly to fool with rainey st parking at night, use the $10 valet. and apparently the <adj> brunch </adj> experience is <adj> different </adj> from dinner - for instance, the carts coming to your table are now filled with pastries. that just makes the process a <adj> whole </adj> lot <adj> easier </adj>. they can leave the <adj> entire </adj> cart.
