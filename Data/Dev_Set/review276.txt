this place <adj> hands-down </adj> had the <adj> best </adj> <adj> fried </adj> chicken that i have ever had. such a perfectly seasoned and <adj> crunchy </adj> batter around their tender chicken pieces. it's an <adj> automatic </adj> 5 based on their chicken. everyone needs to try it. i'll have dreams about it when i go back to toronto. 

i also had a spicy salmon rice ball, which was <adj> good </adj> - came with a <adj> nice </adj> sauce. it was a <adj> little </adj> bit too much rice for my <adj> liking </adj> - but what else was i really expecting out of a rice ball? 

the bibimbap was <adj> good </adj> as well, it's <adj> hard </adj> to judge bibimbap because <adj> most </adj> places are fairly <adj> similar </adj> since it's the <adj> same </adj> ingredient and sauce. but really <adj> good </adj> pieces of beef in it.
