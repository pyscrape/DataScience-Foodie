how to get on the list: 

don't forget your id! this place cards you even if you don't order alcohol because it's "technically" a bar.

be prepared for a 30 - 45 <adj> min </adj> wait during <adj> happy </adj> hour. 

if there's bar table seats, take it!! 

the food isn't too shabby for <adj> happy </adj> hour prices, but nothing really stood out to me except the truffle gnocchi. cause hello! truffle!! 

what we shared: 

ahi tuna - it comes with 2 slices of tuna topped with lentils and kale. it needs a little more flavor, this dish was kind of bland compared to the rest we tried.

truffle gnocchi - butter licking goooood - the cream was the <adj> best </adj> part fa'sho. 

spicy meatballs - a <adj> little </adj> too spicy for my taste buds, i suspect they had red pepper flakes? or whatever those <adj> little </adj> <adj> yellow </adj> pepper seeds are.. 

<adj> top </adj> sirloin - wasn't part of the <adj> happy </adj> hour menu. the steak was a bit too <adj> burnt </adj>, on the edges, <adj> decent </adj> slices though. the cheese in the salad was <adj> delectable </adj>. 

<adj> overall </adj> not too <adj> shabby </adj> for <adj> happy </adj> hour, i wouldn't come here any otherwise.
