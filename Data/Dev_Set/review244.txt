came with a group of friends for a birthday celebration, this restaurant is a tapa restaurant meaning the portions for every tapa are very <adj> small </adj> and is <adj> convenient </adj> for sharing. we ordered two orders of shrimp with gambas, their mussels and their steak skewers. i thought that everything was okay. my <adj> favorite </adj> were the mussels, very <adj> flavorful </adj>.
