<adj> other </adj> than the fact that there's light up adult capri sun here, there's really nothing else here....that is <adj> good </adj>. perhaps the crispy pork belly and the tacos but the <adj> other </adj> items on the menu is a no no. 

do not get the <adj> sweet </adj> potato fries unless you wanna eat <adj> uncooked </adj> fries. the truffle mac and cheese was too <adj> strong </adj>, i wouldn't say it was <adj> good </adj> nor <adj> bad </adj> but it did not wow me. the <adj> only </adj> thing <adj> good </adj> was the tacos and the crispy pork belly. it would have been even better if it wasn't too <adj> salty </adj>. the strawberry soju is definitely better than the rest. it taste <adj> sweet </adj> and looks pretty. i think people come here because of the soju not so much for the food. the menu selection was also <adj> limited </adj>. i wish you can order the soju for take out but you cannot take the light up ice cubes home. 

the wait time was also <adj> ridiculous </adj> when it just opened. the place is very <adj> dim </adj> with very  <adj> tight </adj> and <adj> packed </adj> seatings.
