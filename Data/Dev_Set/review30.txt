this is shocking, right? two stars for the <adj> best </adj> restaurant in seattle? i know, i was quite <adj> disappointed </adj> as well! i've been here on <adj> numerous </adj> accounts over the years and each time i was greeted with <adj> impeccable </adj> service and blown away with <adj> delectable </adj> creations for my palette. although the service remained to be <adj> amazing </adj>, their flavor was off this time, not even factoring the $500 price tag for 3. 

the details:

<adj> hama </adj> <adj> hama </adj> oysters- <adj> hard </adj> to mess up, but came out <adj> less </adj> than chilled. still <adj> good </adj> flavor but eating room temp oysters aren't my thing. 

steak tartare / tuna belly topped with caviar- both <adj> good </adj>; nothing <adj> memorable </adj> but nothing <adj> notable </adj> about the dishes were <adj> horrible </adj> either. 

<adj> truffle </adj> fries- although <adj> rich </adj> in <adj> truffle </adj> flavor, definitely overly salted.

spot prawns- consistency almost tasted <adj> mushy </adj>. flavor was <adj> garlicky </adj> with a hint of citrus; <adj> hard </adj> to mess up this flavor combo, but nothing about this <adj> screamed </adj> "canlis."

duck- always one of the <adj> best </adj> items here, but this time it was <adj> overcooked </adj>. the skin actually had a <adj> perfect </adj> crisp with just the <adj> right </adj> amount of seasoning, but the meat itself was <adj> tough </adj> and with the <adj> overcooked </adj> consistency it seemed to have lost the transfer of the <adj> same </adj> flavor the skin had.

cod- definitely the most <adj> disappointing </adj> dish of the night. served with a <adj> clam </adj> veloute, the light but <adj> creamy </adj> broth was intended to compliment the <adj> fish </adj>. however, the <adj> clam </adj> flavor was overbearing and the broth lacked depth; it tasted like watered down <adj> clam </adj> chowder. the <adj> fish </adj> actually had a "<adj> fishy </adj>" taste and it was as if it seamed like there was no seasoning whatsoever. 

filet mignon- cooked perfectly, but could have benefited from a <adj> nice </adj> sear. 

the staff and service was and is always <adj> amazing </adj>. but this time, the flavors were definitely off; not to canlis standards. the dining experience is quite <adj> lengthy </adj> so we neglected to let them know the feedback <adj> real </adj> time as we didn't want to stay all night, but <adj> i </adj>'m not <adj> sure </adj> what's happening in the kitchen at canlis. was there a change in chefs? definitely not the canlis <adj> i </adj> remembered and not <adj> sure </adj> <adj> i </adj>'ll be back anytime soon.
