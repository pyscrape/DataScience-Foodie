looks like <adj> second </adj> bar - kitchen is the place to be for dinner.  while their menu was <adj> great </adj>, loved the <adj> dessert </adj> wine that was suggested by our waitress, and even the <adj> small </adj> tapas was the <adj> right </adj> portions, my <adj> braised </adj> beef <adj> short </adj> rib served with <adj> truffle </adj> grits, caramelized onions and <adj> brandy </adj> <adj> balsamic </adj> glaze was way too <adj> salty </adj> for my liking.  i was also <adj> disappointed </adj> that my grits was cold by the time it came to our table. it made the taste very <adj> fattening </adj> and <adj> greasy </adj>.  in addition, when i requested to order an espresso, i was later told that their barista had shut down and to make even a cup of coffee was out of the question. oh well... such as life!!  service however was <adj> nice </adj>, and dinning <adj> outdoor </adj> facing the sidewalk wasn't too <adj> bad </adj>.

cheers!
