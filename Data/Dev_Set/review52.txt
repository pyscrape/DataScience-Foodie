love the <adj> positive </adj> customer service here! everyone there is <adj> nice </adj>, <adj> <adj> helpful </adj> </adj> and caring. 
what's <adj> great </adj> is that for a <adj> new </adj> pok shop like themselves, they offer <adj> free </adj> samples if you're <adj> unsure </adj> which one to get. 
i was sharing a <adj> large </adj> "make your <adj> own </adj>" poke bowl with my boyfriend, & for the price you're paying & how <adj> much </adj> you're getting (with <adj> fresh </adj> quality sushi!!!!) is definitely <adj> worth </adj> it! this isn't <adj> like </adj> any of the <adj> other </adj> <adj> pok </adj> places i've tried, but right now this place is on top of my list. 
i don't normally <<adj> adj </adj>> like </<adj> adj </adj>> fruity deserts & honestly i didn't expect to <<adj> adj </adj>> like </<adj> adj </adj>> the <<adj> adj </adj>> dole </<adj> adj </adj>> whip they had. when i first had it, it was <<adj> adj </adj>> amazing </<adj> adj </adj>> !!! its not too <adj> sweet </adj>, and the <adj> red </adj> stuff (idk what its called) perfectly balance the flavor. definitely coming back! 

update 
<adj> i </adj> love one of the workers, her name is kimberly <adj> i </adj> believe.  her positivity and her smile go so well with the place. she def made my <adj> first </adj> visit to gopoke a <adj> <adj> memorable </adj> </>adj one! she was very <adj> <adj> helpful </adj> </adj> & <adj> patient </adj> helping me decide which pok to get since <adj> i </adj>'ve never been to gopok before.
