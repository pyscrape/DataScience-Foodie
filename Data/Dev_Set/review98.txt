<adj> best </adj> poke i've had in nyc yet. the spicy tuna is <adj> delicious </adj> - <adj> huge </adj> pink chunks on a bed of <adj> white </adj> rice (my choice) and strips of ginger, <adj> wonton </adj> chips and <adj> more </adj> <adj> tasty </adj> things.

the <adj> bubble </adj> tea was the <adj> biggest </adj> <adj> letdown </adj> - very cotton candy-sweet, like they poured tons of syrup in it. did not taste like <adj> fresh </adj> tea. would not recommend!

but the poke? a creamy, <adj> savory </adj> bowl of <adj> healthy </adj> deliciousness. 

4 stars!
