being a meat eater, <adj> polish </adj> chow obviously appeals to my <adj> inner </adj> <adj> primordial </adj> <adj> european </adj> ancestry. this place packs a <adj> tasty </adj> wallop while providing <adj> exceptional </adj> value especially for lunch. 

the <adj> white </adj> borsch is <adj> divine </adj>, wonderfully <adj> complex </adj> with a touch of dill in a medium <adj> bodied </adj> base, toss in half an egg and plenty of <adj> polish </adj> ham with a side of potatoes with bacon and it's on. the tripe soup is <adj> bold </adj> and filled with plenty of cow stomach, so <adj> good </adj> for yours, if you like tripe you'll love it. <adj> lunch </adj> specials such as <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage with a <adj> sweet </adj> <adj> red </adj> sauce comes with soup at about $11 for a <adj> sizeable </adj> portion. i really <adj> dug </adj>  pork hocks, gnawing off the bone with the <adj> soft </adj> skin a <adj> top </adj> the moist <adj> flesh </adj> beneath. the cabbage and hunters stew were quite <adj> tasty </adj>, but being cooked in <adj> red </adj> wine lends to a sweeter taste then i've become <adj> accustomed </adj> to, <adj> good </adj>, but perhaps a bit too <adj> sweet </adj>. unfortunately <adj> dinner </adj> plates can be in the <adj> upper </adj> $20's. as afore mentioned reviews all portions are <adj> large </adj>, you will not leave hungry.

definitely an <adj> old </adj> world feel with <adj> dated </adj> walls and pics scattered about. a <adj> stuffed </adj> crow sits upon the beer taps, specializing with <adj> several </adj> <adj> exceptional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> brews @ $7, a lil over priced.  i wonder if the <adj> poor </adj> crow poached the <adj> wrong </adj> cooks garden, forever jailed upon the brass handles for gawker stares as beer after beer passes beneath it's <adj> beak </adj>. now that would be torture.

when in this diminishing <adj> polish </adj> area in brooklyn do yourself a favor and  pop in for a <adj> quick </adj> brew and some wonderfully <adj> tasty </adj>  bites.
