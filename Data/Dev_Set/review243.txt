<adj> nice </adj> place on broadway with tons of seating, either at the bar or a table. tons of drink options ranging from cocktails (those primarily) to wine and beer. i just stuck with wine for the night. all of the dishes sound <adj> great </adj> and i have to say the mussels in the tomato-coconut sauce was definitely my <adj> favorite </adj>. <adj> nice </adj> <adj> big </adj> plump mussels and the sauce was to die for. it comes with bread for dipping which could certainly be <adj> better </adj> bread but thankfully the sauce was so <adj> good </adj> i didn't care. the portions are all <adj> reasonable </adj> too. the website definitely needs to be updated though, the menu is not <adj> reflective </adj> of what is current option-wise or prices. <adj> good </adj> service too!
