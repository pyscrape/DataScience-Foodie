<adj> fantastic </adj> apres-work cocktail and <adj> nibbles </adj> place.
i normally can't stand mid-town manhattan, especially around times  square  and the theatre  district. just too much craziness going on and i hate having to walk through it. after reading the reviews here, i wanted to check it out and seriously, if you like <adj> cleverly-named </adj> and <adj> yummy </adj> cocktails, this is a <adj> great </adj> spot. 
i had the sliders (ok) and the  garlic  fries (to die for and the <adj> best </adj> i've had outside of california) with the ginger rogers cocktail. <adj> generous </adj> and yummy, the crowd here is also <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> cool </adj> and <adj> laid-back </adj> and the waitress i had was also really <adj> nice </adj>.
i hope tourists don't find this place because it's <adj> great </adj> as it is.
