one of my favourites from my <adj> ny </adj> trip. a cute, <adj> vintagey </adj> <adj> little </adj> bar, with a <adj> few </adj> tables and bar seating. we visited initially for <adj> happy </adj> hour, which was 241 on <adj> certain </adj> wines or beers or royales. i made my way through all the royales- think kir, hibiscus, lavender, rose etc. they were <adj> floral </adj> without being over sweet and had plenty of crisp prosecco. 

we had dinner plans but we loved the look of the <adj> french </adj> <adj> small </adj> plates and <adj> classic </adj> cocktails so we headed back a couple of times. the <adj> small </adj> plates were <adj> great </adj> for picking at while drinking their <adj> fabulous </adj> cocktails. the duck confit parmentier was <adj> rich </adj> and <adj> beautiful </adj>. scallop carpaccio was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> oily </adj> but really <adj> fresh </adj> tasting.

we made our way through a <adj> few </adj> cocktails too, so <adj> good </adj> to see my <adj> favourite </adj> aviation on there! the atmosphere is lovely, the staff are <adj> friendly </adj> and the drinks are <adj> beautiful </adj>. go!
