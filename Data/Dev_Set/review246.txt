<adj> i </adj> came here on a <adj> thursday </adj> evening, and was seated in the back. it had a very <adj> relaxed </adj> atmosphere with string lights and <adj> high </adj> ceilings - <adj> super </adj> cute! my friend and <adj> i </adj> started off with a <adj> couple </adj> drinks, <adj> i </adj> had the none ya beeswax? it was a <adj> citrus-y </adj> cocktail topped with beeswax foam. it was the <adj> first </adj> time <adj> i </adj>'ve ever heard of that, but there wasn't <adj> much </adj> to the taste of the foam, <adj> i </adj> think it's just there for intrigue and <adj> aesthetic </adj> purposes. 

food wise, we shared the meatballs, shrimp, and <adj> gnocchi </adj>. i think my favorite was the <adj> gnocchi </adj> - perfectly fluffy, and paired very well with the earthiness of the squash and chanterelle mushrooms. 

the meatballs and shrimp were very <adj> flavorful </adj>, <adj> i </adj> just wish the accompanying bread provided was better. while very <adj> tasty </adj>, these two dishes didn't blow my mind. 

the service was <adj> efficient </adj> and not overpowering. i really enjoyed my time here and will definitely return.
