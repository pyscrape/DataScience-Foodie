now that i've finally had dinner here, i wasn't too <adj> impressed </adj>. service was <adj> great </adj>, and the area is <adj> perfect </adj>, however. so this is definitely a convenient and <adj> great </adj> spot to get food and drinks, but the food we had wasn't all too <adj> great </adj> in the taste department.

<adj> black </adj> and <adj> bleu </adj> pizza: the <adj> best </adj> of our choices, you can't really go <adj> wrong </adj> with pizza
petite <adj> green </adj> salad with shrimp: the shrimp was too <adj> salty </adj>, and the salad was pretty <adj> drenched </adj>
brussel sprouts: too <adj> oily </adj>, <adj> greasy </adj>, and <adj> salty </adj>

though our food choices weren't that <adj> great </adj>, everything else about this restaurant makes up for it!
