we decided to celebrate our anniversary here on nye. we just had to do it one time for the one time. the service, the view, the <adj> overall </adj> experience was just <adj> amazing </adj>. we had the <adj> early </adj> dinner seating, waited in the bar/lounge area. i was kinda worried that they wouldn't be <adj> able </adj> to find me since i only checked in with one person who didn't even check me off anywhere, but minutes later, a hostess (who magically knew our party name) approached us to welcome us to our table. very <adj> nice </adj>. 

it was a <adj> 5-course </adj> set menu. <adj> i </adj> thought the portions were the <adj> perfect </adj> size to be <adj> able </adj> to fully enjoy and appreciate each course rather than trying to stuff <adj> huge </adj> dishes down my throat, trying to taste everything. our menu included the aebelskiver (reminded me of a doughnut hole, it was really <adj> nice </adj> and dainty), <adj> butternut </adj> squash soup, carrot soup (it was served <adj> cold </adj>, very <adj> interesting </adj>. my boyfriend hated it but <adj> i </adj> thought it was <adj> unique </adj> lol), <adj> lobster </adj>, <adj> wagyu </adj> ribeye and a chocolate truffle dessert.

my <adj> favorite </adj> dish would have to be the lobster. it was so <adj> fresh </adj> and buttery, the <adj> best </adj> lobster i've ever tasted! it was also my boyfriend's <adj> favorite </adj>, which is saying a lot since he doesn't even like lobster. he almost gave me his dish when it came! 

<adj> i </adj> thought the service was <adj> impeccable </adj>. our servers took the time to give us information about each dish after they were brought out to us. our <adj> main </adj> server, <adj> i </adj> think his name was <adj> dominic </adj>, <adj> i </adj>'m <adj> soo </adj> sorry if it isn't! <adj> i </adj> thought he was so <adj> warm </adj> and welcoming, and funny too! 

and i guess canlis is known for their valet?? no they didn't take down our names or give us a ticket when we gave them our car, and yes they gave us back the right car :) <adj> super </adj> cool.
