<adj> awesome </adj> place to get <adj> polish </adj> food!! the decor is in the theme of a log cabin, which is really <adj> cozy </adj>. they have a <adj> large </adj> selection of wine and beer. the pierogies are a must to try! 

my only complaint is that the waitresses all seemed to be in a <adj> constant </adj> hurry the entire time we were there. this was in spite of the fact that <adj> less </adj> than half of the tables were occupied. i'm not <adj> sure </adj> if this is <adj> common </adj>, or if we just happened to have come at a particularly <adj> bad </adj> time. nevertheless, the food is worth the visit!
