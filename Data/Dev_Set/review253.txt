had drinks and dinner on a <adj> friday </adj> night. the place was crowded, and we had <adj> great </adj> service. servers and manager helped us try drinks that that were and that were not on the menu. the <adj> outdoor </adj> seating area is <adj> spacious </adj> and <adj> great </adj>, and with the <adj> retractable </adj> roof looks like a <adj> great </adj> place to hangout in the summer. we ordered a <adj> wide </adj> variety off the menu and none of us were disappointed. basically these folks can do no <adj> wrong </adj> with potatoes. totally <adj> delicious </adj>! <adj> great </adj> spot, i will definitely be back!
