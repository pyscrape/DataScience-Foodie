vino santo is a <adj> great </adj> <adj> little </adj> <adj> italian </adj> spot on <adj> busy </adj> lincoln ave. in willow glen.  i made reservations through <adj> open </adj> table for 5, just to make <adj> sure </adj> we'd be <adj> able </adj> to get a table right away.  we were <adj> sat </adj> right in the front next to the <adj> fragrant </adj> christmas tree.  

we shared a bottle of wine, the wine was pretty <adj> good </adj>, obviously marked up a lot <adj> more </adj> than it should have been, but oh well, i wanted wine.  i started off with the caesar salad and it was served as a wedge and the dressing was very <adj> delicious </adj>! for <adj> main </adj> course i got the sausage ravioli, it was very <adj> delicious </adj>.  <adj> little </adj> pillows of sausage filled ravioli with with pancetta, and a butter, sage sauce. so <adj> good </adj>. 

our service was alright throughout the night, our waiter checked in on us once we got our food, but it seemed that the <adj> other </adj> tables may have been <adj> more </adj> <adj> interesting </adj> to him because it was <adj> rare </adj> we got our water glasses filled and we didn't get <adj> more </adj> <adj> bread </adj> when we had asked for it.  since we were up in the front of the <adj> small </adj> restaurant, there was a room divider that was <adj> right </adj> <adj> next </adj> to our table and it fell, twice.  the <adj> first </adj> time my friend noticed in time to stop it, then the <adj> second </adj> time it just bam! landed <adj> flat </adj> on the hostess stand.  it just was a very <adj> odd </adj> experience, i know we didn't do anything <adj> wrong </adj>, but it felt like we were treated as we had done something <adj> wrong </adj>.  

lastly, there was 5 of us, and a child.  the kid didn't eat, she had a piece of bread, we didn't order her a meal.  we got our bill and it included <adj> automatic </adj> 20% gratuity!  i'm guessing it's because there is "6 total" but i didn't see anywhere on the menu where a stated that a 20% gratuity would be added for parties of "<adj> x </adj>" or more.  it's not that i didn't want to tip our waiter, but i don't think it should have been added in for me without my knowledge.  

i may come to vin santo again if i really <adj> want </adj> <adj> italian </adj> and i just happen to be on lincoln, but nothing really jumped out at me as being something i absolutely had to come back for.
