the lady by the counter was <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> informative </adj>. i wanted something not <adj> cold </adj> to drink besides coffee so i ordered a bottle of tea. she literally went out of the way to the basement to get me a non refrigerated bottle of tea. now that is <adj> true </adj> customer service. i had no idea she was going to do that. ordered a <adj> salmon </adj> poke bowl on quinoa. ingredients were definitely <adj> fresh </adj>. it was interesting with corn flakes and quinoa since it gave it texture/crunch to the <adj> salmon </adj>. it also has an <adj> asian </adj> touch to the dish. <adj> cute </adj> <adj> little </adj> shop with <adj> communal </adj> table. would be even <adj> better </adj> if they had a <adj> bigger </adj> <adj> hot </adj> drink selection. <adj> wish </adj> i had the chance to try the bento box. maybe <adj> next </adj> time when i'm in the area. it is a bit out of the way from where i'm usually hanging in chinatown.
