i had this spot bookmarked ever since it was opened a <adj> couple </adj> months ago and <adj> glad </adj> i finally got to try it this <adj> past </adj> saturday.  the food and service were <adj> top </adj> notch!  i made a reservation for 17 people (birthday party) and bernard (the director of customer relations) was kind <adj> enough </adj> to take us in (their limit for group is 15).  <adj> prior </adj> to the date of the reservation, bernard kept in <adj> constant </adj> email contact with me to update me on the <adj> pre-fixe </adj> menu he designed for me and i really appreciated the attentiveness!  our reservation was for the <adj> earliest </adj> time of 6:00 pm on a saturday and i am so <adj> glad </adj> we made a reservation because this place gets packed!  here are the food we had and my thoughts:

crispy chicken ($8.00): chicken with sweet and spicy sauce and <adj> black </adj> sesame crumbles.  all my friends said this looked like <adj> general </adj> tso's chicken but i can assure all of you it tastes nothing like that!  the chicken here was packed with flavor!

tuna tataki ($12.00): hummus coulis, sesame vinaigrette, crunchy quinoa, <adj> serrano </adj> pepper and sumac.  this was served with <adj> light </adj> wasabi paste and it was so <adj> good </adj>!

<adj> edamame </adj> dumplings ($10.00): steamed, citrus <adj> truffle </adj> oil and <adj> green </adj> pepper.  my group was not a <adj> big </adj> fan of this dish... it was a bit too <adj> doughy </adj> and bland for our taste.

<adj> soft </adj> shell crab ($11.00):  i highly recommend this dish!  you can eat every part of the <adj> soft </adj> shell crab - it was <adj> delicious </adj>!

gnocchi ($10.00): made with <adj> korean </adj> chili pepper sauce, <adj> garlic </adj> aioli, seaweed crunch.  this is a <adj> potato-based </adj> dish and it was really <adj> good </adj>.  the texture is more towards the rice cake side and there is a spicy kick to it!

avocado ($9.00): a very <adj> basic </adj> avocado dish... i wouldn't recommend it... the portion was a bit <adj> small </adj> for the price.

<adj> angry </adj> <adj> sweet </adj> potato ($9.00): i absolutely love love love this dish!  it's basically <adj> sweet </adj> potato fries with <adj> sriacha </adj> goat cheese.  the fries were packed with flavors and the <adj> sriacha </adj> goat cheese was surprisingly a really <adj> good </adj> pairing!

steak ($12.00): i personally did not try this <adj> dish </adj> but all my friends were raving about how <adj> good </adj> it was!

kimchi paella ($12.00): came with <adj> white </adj> tiger shrimp, mussles and caramelized kimchi.  i love how the rice is <adj> super </adj> thick in this <adj> dish </adj> - it's really <adj> good </adj>.

truffle mac & <adj> cheese </adj> ($9.00): one of the <adj> best </adj> <adj> truffled </adj> mac and <adj> cheese </adj> i've ever had!  the mac & <adj> cheese </adj> was cooked perfectly and i love how it's <adj> soooo </adj> cheesy.

bread pudding ($9.00): omg this dessert is out of this world!!!!  it was sooo <adj> good </adj>.  the texture of the dessert is sort of mushy but it's <adj> super </adj> <adj> delicious </adj>.  i highly recommend this!

<adj> popcorn </adj> ice cream ($9.00): i didn't get to try this but heard <adj> good </adj> feedback from it!

our <adj> whole </adj> group also got drinks and adult capri suns - they were all very <adj> good </adj> and i love how the capri suns light up!

<adj> overall </adj> - i had a <adj> great </adj> <adj> first </adj> time experience at thursday kitchen thanks to bernard's hospitality.  i can't wait to go back again soon just for a <adj> small </adj> dinner!
