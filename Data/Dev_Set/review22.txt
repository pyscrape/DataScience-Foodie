i'm <adj> new </adj> to seattle and everyone seems to answer "canlis" when i ask "what's the <adj> best </adj> foodie restaurant in seattle". i reserved a table for two for my birthday and opted for the four course menu, rather than the 9 course tasting menu. i also chose the <adj> classic </adj> wine pairing.  

unfortunately, there wasn't much about the experience that met my expectations, and nothing that exceeded them. 

the staff were <adj> friendly </adj> and accommodating, although our  server seemed not to know the menu and wines well. generally, we struggled to understand one another. i was hoping for <adj> more </adj> guidance with both food and wine choices, to maximize the experience. 

i thought the food was what one might expect at a <adj> casual </adj> dining restaurant. there was nothing <adj> extraordinary </adj> about any of our courses - they were mostly <adj> good </adj>.  i was disappointed by my <adj> main </adj> course,  "pork with radicchio, apple, fennel, and a sauce of drippings and <adj> black </adj> garlic".  everything on the plate was <adj> beige </adj> - completely void of color - and the pork <adj> under-cooked </adj>. no exaggeration. 

i enjoyed the spot prawns and <adj> sweet </adj> onions (presentation on the latter was lovely) but these were both very <adj> small </adj> tasting portions. i also had the steak tartare which was, in my opinion, <adj> heavy-handed </adj>. i am accustomed to this <adj> dish </adj> being delicate. the beef seemed as though it were ground rather than <adj> thin </adj> shaved. this <adj> dish </adj> was all <adj> red </adj> - garnish and all, no variation in color, save for a dollop of what i think was called an egg 'puree'. 

the view from our table was <adj> great </adj>, looking out over <adj> lake </adj> union, but the restaurant itself was bland, also void of color. <adj> white </adj> table clothes all over adorned with nothing charming or visually appealing. it felt as though there were a 'no color' rule at canlis. 

all in all, i was expecting an <adj> extraordinary </adj> meal and experience but didn't receive either.  the check came to $366 for two people, including the 20% <adj> mandatory </adj> tip. 

i'm <adj> glad </adj> to have tried canlis but am <adj> disappointed </adj> i didn't put nearly $400 to <adj> better </adj> use.
