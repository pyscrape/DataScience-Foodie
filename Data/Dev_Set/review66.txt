i was instantly intrigued when i noticed that a <adj> korean </adj> restaurant was not located in <adj> k-town </adj>. <adj> korean </adj> fusion/tapas is something you don't normally see and i knew i was in for a treat. thursday kitchen is <adj> cozy </adj> and <adj> intimate </adj> and boasts a <adj> rustic </adj> <adj> chic </adj> vibe. <adj> awesome </adj> service from start to finish.

we were a group of six and came in on a <adj> saturday </adj> night around 6:45. since the restaurant does not seat you until your <adj> whole </adj> party arrives, we were very <adj> glad </adj> to find that we could order drinks at the bar while waiting (there is always one person who is late...). i got a ms. cutetini, which was refreshing and <adj> light </adj>, and my friend got a <adj> lychee </adj> reach rich, which was <adj> sweet </adj> and fun. both drinks were <adj> stronger </adj> than anticipated and of course, it is always fun to drink a <adj> light </adj>-up drink in a <adj> pouch </adj>. 

the food was equally as fun. the kitchen does a <adj> great </adj> job of cooking <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> korean </adj> dishes and adding <adj> creative </adj> twists to each. some of the flavors were very <adj> unique </adj> and 'fusion' was accomplished. standouts of the night included the kimchi paella (<adj> more </adj> of a <adj> risotto </adj> texture but it was so <adj> flavorful </adj> and the caramelized kimchi made the dish) and the crispy chicken (a glorified <adj> general </adj> tso's chicken, tender and juicy, <adj> instant </adj> kick of flavor). 

there was a <adj> constant </adj> stream of people coming in and <adj> average </adj> wait time (overheard from our table) was at <adj> least </adj> 40 minutes. come earlier or later than the dinner rush hour and not only will your wait time be less, but you can get a <adj> free </adj> beer with your yelp check-in (<adj> 6-6:30 </adj> and <adj> 10-close </adj>).

<adj> overall </adj>, thursday kitchen is <adj> fun </adj> and definitely something <adj> worth </adj> trying at <adj> least </adj> once. but, i would recommend thursday kitchen for <adj> smaller </adj> parties because 1) it will be <adj> easier </adj> to get seated and 2) it will be <adj> easier </adj> to leave with <adj> full </adj> stomachs - our party of six spent a bit ($$) but none of us left <adj> full </adj>. we had to grab a <adj> second </adj> dinner.
