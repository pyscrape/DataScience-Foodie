reasons i love thursday kitchen:

1. <adj> great </adj> food -- we got the <adj> soft </adj> shelled crab, <adj> angry </adj> sweet potatoes, kimchi paella, <adj> edamame </adj> dumplings, and <adj> popcorn </adj> ice cream for <adj> dessert </adj>. every single dish was <adj> wonderful </adj>. the paella was a <adj> better </adj> texture and <adj> more </adj> <adj> flavorful </adj> than <adj> most </adj> <adj> spanish </adj> and <adj> latin </adj> <adj> american </adj> places i've been to in nyc. 4 dishes (5 if you include <adj> dessert </adj>) is <adj> plenty </adj> for two people to split and each dish is roughly $9-$12. 
2. $3 beer any time of night. always a plus. 
3. $1 coffee. yes please. 
4. <adj> good </adj> service. our server was <adj> friendly </adj>, <adj> attentive </adj> and <adj> knowledgeable </adj> about the menu. made <adj> great </adj> recommendations. 
5. <adj> nice </adj> atmosphere. it's not such a <adj> big </adj> place and it's <adj> popular </adj>, so get there close to opening if you don't want to wait. but it's cozy and  well  decorated. 
6. this is a <adj> big </adj> one...glowing <adj> soju </adj> capri sun style drinks. this is a game changer. they serve you alcohol in a glowing pouch. whoever though of this is a genius!!! the in we child in me leapt for joy upon discovering this menu item. 

over very <adj> positive </adj> experience.
