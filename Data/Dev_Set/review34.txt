basis for my <adj> starred </adj> ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  never again.
2 stars:  <adj> poor </adj> food, <adj> poor </adj> experience, <adj> extraordinary </adj> measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  average, nothing really <adj> special </adj>, nothing particularly <adj> bad </adj>.
4 stars:  very <adj> good </adj>, would definitely return.
5 stars:  a favorite, one of the <adj> best </adj>.

more like 4.5 stars for reasons to be explained later.  i struggle with reviewing restaurants like canlis since i do <adj> side-by-side </adj> comparisons.  of course i compare to other <adj> fine </adj> dining that i've had <adj> nationwide </adj>, but do i compare it to michelin <adj> starred </adj> places even though michelin doesn't go to seattle?  as it's generally considered the <adj> nicest </adj> <adj> fine </adj> dining establishment in seattle, do i compare it just to other <adj> top </adj> restaurants in other cities that aren't michelin <adj> starred </adj>?  

what ti boils down to, the meal was <adj> excellent </adj> but not one of the <adj> best </adj> of our lives, which is why i can't give it 5 stars.  the menu consisted of:

escarole, olives, anchovies - a <adj> fine </adj> starter but nothing mind-blowing
scallops - very <adj> good </adj>, one of the <adj> best </adj> dishes of the night
fluke - served <adj> sashimi-style </adj> with strawberries.  interesting, not compelling.  <adj> weakest </adj> dish.
<adj> black </adj> cod - another <adj> excellent </adj> dish, helps that <adj> black </adj> cod is so <adj> fatty </adj>
pork - a <adj> middling </adj> dish in the group
strawberry with fromage blanc - an <adj> average </adj> <adj> fine </adj> dining dessert
apricots and chocolate - ditto here

the wine pairing was also <adj> nice </adj>, paired fairly well, but nothing surprising with a pairing and no very <adj> interesting </adj> wines.

so the meal was very <adj> good </adj>, deserving of 4 stars.  i guess the 1/2 star bump would go to ambiance and venue - <adj> gorgeous </adj> - and the fact that if you ask for a tour of the property, they will oblige with a <adj> short </adj> tour around the house.  this was a <adj> nice </adj> touch.

my other struggle is this - we also went to art of the table in the <adj> same </adj> trip and for <adj> less </adj> money (and of course, <adj> worse </adj> ambiance) we has food that tasted just as <adj> excellent </adj>, if not more so.  food for thought.
