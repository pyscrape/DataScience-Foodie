<adj> typical </adj> <adj> low-end </adj> buffet quality sushi.  the reason students rate this so highly is because they can't cook anything other than ramen noodles and rice at home.  lol.  i've gotten better quality quality poke at a local kroger (qfc or fry's).  

while the service was <adj> good </adj> and the workers <adj> passionate </adj>, the freshness of sushi suffers.  management really needs to look into not serving sushi that has gone <adj> bad </adj>.  some of the sushi tasted like it went <adj> bad </adj>.  i only ate one or two <adj> bad </adj> pieces and threw the rest away.  even then, i felt a <adj> nauseated </adj> feeling hours later.

<adj> overall </adj> at <adj> best </adj> this is <adj> low-end </adj> sushi buffet quality, at <adj> worst </adj>, you can get <adj> sick </adj> eating this.
