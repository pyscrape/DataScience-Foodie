the dragons made me do it! i was wandering around <adj> chinatown </adj> looking for a lunch spot when i saw some lunar <adj> new </adj> year dragons dancing on the street and went over to watch. once the firecracker smoke cleared, i realized i was standing in front of <adj> go </adj> poke, a place i'd been meaning to try. it must have been <adj> destiny </adj>.

if you've never had poke before, go poke is a <adj> good </adj> place to start. it'<adj> s </adj> <adj> clean </adj>, <adj> spacious </adj>, and <adj> bright </adj> inside, and the staff is <adj> extremely <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> helpful </adj> in explaining how it works. first, you'll choose between a poke bowl or burrito, and then you just go down the line, choosing the flavor(<adj> s </adj>) of poke you want, sides like cucumber salad and crab salad, and <adj> extra </adj> add-ones like avocado. i asked how spicy the spicy ahi was, and they offered me a sample to help me decide. 

the fish was <adj> fresh </adj> and good-quality, and the portion size is <adj> generous </adj>. they do have a <adj> vegetarian </adj> tofu option, though at $11 for the <adj> basic </adj> single-flavor bowl, i'm not <adj> sure </adj> it would be a <adj> great </adj> value for non-fish-eaters. they also offer <adj> hawaiian-style </adj> chips and <adj> soft </adj> drinks, and dole whip <adj> pineapple </adj> <adj> soft </adj> serve. you can pay $3 extra for a mason jar and bring it back for a discount, and i love dole whips so much i might just do that!

the dining area is <adj> nice </adj>, and convenient for a <adj> weekday </adj> lunch. service is fast, because everything is <adj> pre-made </adj> and just needs to be dished up. there's a counter that runs along the front windows for solo diners, and several <adj> small </adj> tables for groups of two and four. they offer lids for the bowls if you want to take them to go, so they'd travel pretty well, but it seemed like <adj> most </adj> people stayed to dine in. the servers came around offering <adj> free </adj> miso soup, and they offered to bring out my dole whip later in the meal so it wouldn't melt while i was eating. 

it's not the <adj> cheapest </adj>  place for lunch - there's nothing under $10, and it's <adj> likely </adj> to be <adj> closer </adj> to $15 if you get a drink, side, or anything but the <adj> cheapest </adj> menu item. still, the thoughtful, <adj> personal </adj> touches and <adj> friendly </adj>  staff made it a <adj> great </adj> experience and worth the price.
