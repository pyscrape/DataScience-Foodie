<adj> i </adj> really loved our experience at emmer & rye.  the team has been in <adj> austin </adj> for two weeks now and we needed to let loose a <adj> little </adj> bit and get out of the domain where we've been staying / working. <adj> ive </adj> been asking around for the restaurant to try in <adj> austin </adj> right now, and this has consistently been at the top.  made reservations for 3 but unfortunately didnt know they had a patio, so we waited a bit for seating <adj> outside </adj> but were <adj> unsuccessful </adj>. oh well!  the space indoors is <adj> super </adj> chic and well appointed, so <adj> i </adj> didnt mind at all.  there is also bar seating, and kitchen counter seating where you can get see the <adj> entire </adj> kitchen in action. pretty <adj> awesome </adj>.

the menu is not <adj> extensive </adj>, but everything on it looked <adj> amazing </adj>. they recommend 2 dishes off the menu per person, then take a look at the dim <adj> sum </adj> cart items to supplement your meal. this worked out perfectly!  off the menu we got - <adj> fresh </adj> cheese with grain cracker, beef tartar, chicken roulade, <adj> short </adj> rib carnitas, and the cacio e pepe. <adj> amazing </adj> <adj> amazing </adj> flavors!  and the menu apparently changes daily!  off the dim <adj> sum </adj> cart we got - salad, <adj> fried </adj> pork, and <adj> shishito </adj> peppers.  the cocktails we ordered were also really <adj> yummy </adj>, and the server was <adj> knowledgeable </adj> about some very <adj> obscure </adj> <adj> italian </adj> wine and could tell us boatloads! i was <adj> super </adj> <adj> impressed </adj>.

all in all included the meal was about 200, totally <adj> reasonable </adj>. to be <adj> honest </adj> <adj> i </adj> havent had a <adj> bad </adj> meal in austin, but this might be <adj> top </adj> of the list. <adj> i </adj> left emmer & rye perfectly <adj> content </adj>, with warmth in my heart. the hospitality and service that <adj> i </adj>'ve received in austin really is something else!
