<adj> small </adj> place with <adj> friendly </adj> service, <adj> cute </adj> decorations and very <adj> reasonably-priced </adj> food. <adj> i </adj> had the <adj> salmon </adj> poke bowl with quinoa as the base and <adj> sunflower </adj> seeds for the crunch.  the quinoa was sprouted and perfectly cooked and the <adj> salmon </adj> and <adj> vegetable </adj> were <adj> yummy </adj> and <adj> fresh </adj>.  <adj> i </adj> brought a potato croquette back for my boyfriend, and that was a very <adj> tasty </adj> treat. <adj> i </adj> love that this is conveniently located just a block from the <adj> grand </adj> street train stop, and <adj> i </adj> look forward to making this a <adj> regular </adj> stop for a <adj> healthy </adj> and <adj> filling </adj> meal (<adj> oh </adj> yeah, portions are <adj> generous </adj>, too).
