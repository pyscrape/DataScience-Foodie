<adj> korean </adj> fusion tapas! 
this place is fairly <adj> small </adj> so be prepared to wait or come <adj> early </adj>. we came on a <adj> tuesday </adj> night, and our party of 7 didn't have to wait tooo long. maybe like 30 mins or so? there's a cash bar at the front though, so you can wait around here if you'd like!

my friend and i were excited about the capri-thursdays (<adj> hehh </adj> get it?) because why not?? light up drinks?? obvi. 
we both got the lychee - mango one, and it was <adj> delicious </adj>! but totally <adj> hype </adj>. had to use the "it's <adj> lit </adj>" sticker on snapchat though! always for the snap :p

since we were a <adj> larger </adj> party, our waiter suggested ordering two of each dish we wanted, which was a <adj> great </adj> idea. 

i loved every single dish we got! 
-octopus: <adj> delicious </adj> flavor. slightly on the <adj> smaller </adj> side. the octopus is sliced very thinly and served chilled. <adj> good </adj> appetizer

-truffle mac and cheese: had to get this based on reviews! you can literally smell the truffle when you walk in the door. very <adj> cheesy </adj> and <adj> ooey </adj> gooey. truffle flavor lasted throughout the <adj> whole </adj> dish.

-chicharron pork belly: our server told us this was cooked for five hours. 5!! and it was definitely reflected in the taste, texture, everything. <adj> super </adj> crispy on the outside, <adj> fatty </adj> and juicy underneath. one of my <adj> favorite </adj> dishes

-<adj> kimchi </adj> paella: hearty and filling! the <adj> kimchi </adj> flavor is balanced well with the cheese, and it's not too overbearing. comes with three mussels and two shrimps! very <adj> creamy </adj> and <adj> risotto-like </adj>

-steak: cooked to perfection! so <adj> happy </adj> with this dish. it's also served with kale and grits. also one of my <adj> favorite </adj> dishes because of how the steak was cooked and the flavors.

i love how each dish is served -- attention to detail is a <adj> strong </adj> suit here, and i really appreciate that! our servers also explained each dish when they came out, which was <adj> helpful </adj>.
definitely coming back to try everything else!
