ambiance: 
i love a <adj> good </adj> downtown restaurant with plenty of seating, <adj> good </adj> lighting, and an <adj> outdoor </adj> area. <adj> second </adj> bar - kitchen checks all three off the list. i was seated inside the <adj> last </adj> time i went and i can't say i would choose the <adj> same </adj> spot again. the <adj> interior </adj> noise level on a <adj> friday </adj> night was <adj> crazy </adj> loud. i could barely hear the <adj> soft-spoken </adj> waiter try to upsell. <adj> next </adj> time, i will sit <adj> outside </adj>. 

cuisine:
whoa. this food is <adj> good </adj>. i, like the <adj> next </adj> <adj> true </adj> texan, love deep <adj> fried </adj> pickles from the local grease spoon, but this place can fry a <adj> mean </adj> <adj> pickle </adj>. their take on the <adj> most </adj> <adj> basic </adj> dish is <adj> revolutionary </adj>. yes, it's a <adj> pickle </adj> revolution. <adj> pickle </adj> slices, drizzled in <adj> hot </adj> sauce, dipped in ranch it all sounds so <adj> basic </adj>, but its <adj> executed </adj> flawlessly. i also had their skirt steak dish, which was cook to a <adj> perfect </adj> medium rare and served over a bed of crispy potatoes. the <adj> whole </adj> meal was <adj> excellent </adj> and if you were <adj> strategic </adj> about your choices, your bill wouldn't even put a dent in your wallet.  

service:
for a restaurant that does not take reservations, the hostess was charming and <adj> easy </adj> going. i would imagine her job isn't the <adj> friendliest </adj> on <adj> friday </adj> nights, but she handled the commotion with grace. our waiter was also laid back and friendly. they either purposefully hire a <adj> certain </adj> type of <adj> carefree </adj> employees or put something in their brownies.
