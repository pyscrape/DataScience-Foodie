come here for the poke bowls! <adj> super </adj> <adj> fresh </adj>, packed with <adj> ingredients/add </adj> ons, so <adj> filling </adj>.
unlike other poke places where you build your <adj> own </adj> bowl by choosing ingredients in an assembly line fashion, simple has pre-made options, but all contain ingredients you would want anyways! 
you choose based on the protein, then decide what base and what <adj> extra </adj> crunchies you want to add. 
i assume they assemble their ingredients/sauces based on what they think goes best with the protein. <adj> most </adj> are <adj> similar </adj>, with a <adj> few </adj> substitutes.

i've gotten the ahi tuna and the spicy tuna. both are <adj> delicious </adj>! ahi tuna comes with <adj> sliced </adj> tuna, vs. the spicy tuna is chunks. i love that they put mango!
they pack it with rice at the bottom, so it's very <adj> filling </adj>.

my only criticism is i <adj> wish </adj> it were sliced avocado, instead of <adj> mashed </adj> avocado. but still <adj> delicious </adj>!
seating is pretty limited here, but we haven't had a problem the two times we came. you may just need to wait a <adj> little </adj> bit. it's <adj> easier </adj> in the summer when you can walk somewhere and eat <adj> outside </adj>. but for the winter months, it's best you wait. 

definitely have to try their katsu. <adj> huuuge </adj> portions.
