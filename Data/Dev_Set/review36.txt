it's just over rated for the price. i went to celebrate my birthday with a <adj> couple </adj> friends. i believe we ordered 4 courses and 2 additions. the course structure is such that each dish is like a <adj> main </adj> in that they are the <adj> same </adj> proportion. <adj> most </adj> of the dishes were just ok. the <adj> main </adj> protein dish, which was duck literally had 4 pieces of breast meat, which imo were barely <adj> better </adj> than the ducks hanging in the window at <adj> uwajimaya </adj>. there was also a milk poached meat dish that was literally <adj> repulsive </adj> in taste and appearance (like fish in a <adj> cold </adj> sperm soup). service was also <adj> slow </adj> with an <adj> average </adj> time of <adj> 15-20 </adj> minutes between each course. we ate too much bread and butter due to the delays.

it's coasting on it's reputation.
