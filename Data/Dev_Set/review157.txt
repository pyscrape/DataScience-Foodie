went here <adj> last </adj> night and had the <adj> best </adj> experience! we sat at the bar even though there was only a 25 minute wait at 9 on a <adj> friday </adj> night (which amazed us!)

the bar staff was so <adj> amazing </adj>, suggested the <adj> best </adj> drinks to order and were beyond <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> knowledgeable </adj> of <adj> other </adj> places to visit while we were here in austin from <adj> omaha </adj>. being from <adj> omaha </adj> expectations for a <adj> good </adj> steak are pretty <adj> high </adj>, and i was in heaven. devoured my <adj> flank </adj> steak (<adj> medium </adj> rare) way too fast but it was so <adj> delicious </adj> i couldn't help it! paired perfectly with my bourbon drink ;) thank you to taylor, kenny and damn it i'm <adj> sorry </adj> but i forgot the name of the bartender who helped us <adj> most </adj> of all but everything was <adj> amazing </adj>. <adj> great </adj> conversations, <adj> amazing </adj> food, quick and <adj> great </adj> service. we'll be back when we visit again!
