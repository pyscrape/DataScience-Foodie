wow.
<adj> i </adj> love this place. right away the customer service was <<adj> adj </adj>> <adj> friendly </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>> and kept blowing me away the <adj> longer </adj> <adj> i </adj> was there. an employee, <adj> i </adj> think he said his name may have been michael (?), asked for my and my friend's names and offered us samples. <<adj> adj </adj>> super helpful </<adj> adj </adj>>, <<adj> adj </adj>> patient </<adj> adj </adj>> , and <<adj> adj </adj>> kind </<adj> adj </adj>>. <adj> i </adj> tried the spicy version of their salmon, tuna, and tako (octopus). it was all so <adj> good </adj> <adj> i </adj> ended up ordering their <adj> customized </adj> poke bowl "<adj> fi-yah </adj>" that comes with those 3. they have all sorts of poke variety (<adj> sweet </adj>, spicy, standard; tuna, salmon, tako) and <adj> i </adj> was surprised to see the tako option. one of those <adj> rare </adj> restaurants where the variety did not <adj> diminish </adj> quality. oh and they offered my friend and <adj> i </adj> miso soup on the house! we of course welcomed that on a <adj> rainy </adj> day.

they have an option to upgrade your size for $5, so <adj> i </adj> did that since <adj> i </adj> was planning on sharing it with someone later. it was <adj> huge </adj>. <adj> i </adj> was so <adj> pleased </adj> with the layers of poke scoops they gave me (especially since king size ended up being $20).

<<adj> adj </adj>> most </<adj> adj </adj>> of their toppings are pretty <<adj> adj </adj>> standard </<adj> adj </adj>> to <<adj> adj </adj>> many </<adj> adj </adj>> poke places, but they did have spicy crab salad which was <<adj> adj </adj>> cool </<adj> adj </adj>> and <<adj> adj </adj>> different </<adj> adj </adj>>. everything was <<adj> adj </adj>> <adj> delicious </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>>.

 lastly, the decoration and vibe in there was bright and warm! it really reminded me of being in hawaii despite that it was raining and cloudy <adj> right </adj> outside. 

poke has been popping up all over now (yay!) and this restaurant definitely stands out in all categories: food, atmosphere, and service.
