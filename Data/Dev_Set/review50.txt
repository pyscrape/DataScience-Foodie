wow.
i love this place. right away the customer service was <adj> friendly </adj> and kept blowing me away the <adj> longer </adj> i was there. an employee, i think he said his name may have been michael (?), asked for my and my friend's names and offered us samples. <adj> super helpful </adj>, <adj> patient </adj> , and <adj> kind </adj>. i tried the spicy version of their salmon, tuna, and tako (octopus). it was all so <adj> good </adj> i ended up ordering their <adj> customized </adj> poke bowl "<adj> fi-yah </adj>" that comes with those 3. they have all sorts of poke variety (<adj> sweet </adj>, spicy, standard; tuna, salmon, tako) and i was surprised to see the tako option. one of those <adj> rare </adj> restaurants where the variety did not <adj> diminish </adj> quality. oh and they offered my friend and i miso soup on the house! we of course welcomed that on a <adj> rainy </adj> day.

they have an option to upgrade your size for $5, so i did that since i was planning on sharing it with someone later. it was <adj> huge </adj>. i was so <adj> pleased </adj> with the layers of poke scoops they gave me (especially since king size ended up being $20).

<adj> most </adj> of their toppings are pretty <adj> standard </adj> to <adj> many </adj> poke places, but they did have spicy crab salad which was <adj> cool </adj> and <adj> different </adj>. everything was <adj> delicious </adj>.

 lastly, the decoration and vibe in there was bright and warm! it really reminded me of being in hawaii despite that it was raining and cloudy <adj> right </adj> outside. 

poke has been popping up all over now (yay!) and this restaurant definitely stands out in all categories: food, atmosphere, and service.
