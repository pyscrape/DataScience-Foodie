came here <adj> last </adj> night.  a bit <adj> rainy </adj> out so <adj> expected </adj> to see almost no one.  there was enough to keep everyone <adj> busy </adj> here.  we sat at the bar. 2 of us.  jason helped us and made recommendations for <adj> happy </adj> hour.  i have the hollow ridge cab i think it was.  <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> nice </adj>.  im not a <adj> huge </adj> wine guy myself but it was a <adj> nice </adj> glass of wine.  i did not eat however my friend had the <adj> short </adj> ribs and couldnt stop raving about how <adj> good </adj> they were.  not gonna lie a bit <adj> pricey </adj> but hey its lincoln avenue and its a <adj> great </adj> place when you might want to put on your dang <adj> ole </adj> <adj> fancy </adj> pants for the night.  expect to pay about 6 to 10 for a glass of wine and 20 bucks a plate for food.  if you know that ahead of time you will be <adj> good </adj> i think.  like that one guy said once...." i'll be back!"
