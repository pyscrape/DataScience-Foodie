karczma is located in the heart of greenpoint, brooklyn (aka the home of the <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> polish </adj> people) so you've come to the <adj> right </adj> place for <adj> authentic </adj> polska food. inside you'll find an array of people, but <adj> best </adj> believe <adj> polish </adj> people come here because the food is <adj> legit </adj>. received a menu with nothing but <adj> polish </adj> inside? <adj> nie </adj> rozumiem po polsku? do not fear, they have an <adj> english </adj> menu. the waitresses wear <adj> traditional </adj> folk dresses and the decor is <adj> rustic </adj> with a farmhouse feel. 

before ordering anything, you must order the zurek. (on the menu as barszcz biay / <adj> white </adj> borscht). this soup is probably one of my <adj> favorite </adj> things in the world. it comes with potatoes with bacon; put the potatoes and bacon in the soup. it's a must! order the <adj> cheese </adj> <adj> and/or </adj> meat perogis and make <adj> sure </adj> they're <adj> pan </adj> <adj> fried </adj>, as well as <adj> traditional </adj> kielbasa. once you get these <adj> major </adj> staples down, i would recommend trying <adj> other </adj> things <adj> such </adj> as the hunters bacon, the <adj> stuffed </adj> cabbage, or the spicy beef goulash over <adj> potato </adj> pancake. 

the prices are beyond <adj> reasonable </adj>, the food is <adj> delicious </adj>, and the portions are <adj> large </adj>. be prepared to wait at <adj> least </adj> 15 mins- if you're coming in during dinner time. order a beer at the bar, zywiec recommended, to pass time - <adj> na </adj> zdrowie!
