this is a <adj> great </adj> <adj> tapas </adj> place! they give you lots of bread that is crispy on the <adj> outside </adj> and <adj> soft </adj> on the inside with your meal. we ordered the steak tartare, fig and goat cheese tartines, duck rillettes, and butterfly salmon. the steak tartare was definitely the highlight of everything we ordered. the meat tastes <adj> fresh </adj> and has a <adj> nice </adj> mild flavor. the fig and goat cheese tartines were amazing except for the bread that was a <adj> little </adj> bit <adj> tough </adj> and <adj> chewy </adj>. i have never had duck rillettes before but after having this one, i will definitely try <adj> more </adj>! the butterfly salmon was <adj> okay </adj>, nothing to write home about.

i also ordered <adj> blue </adj> cocktail (i don't remember the name of it but it had something to do with a lady in a <adj> blue </adj> dress.) the server drink served me the drink with a <adj> back </adj> story which i thought was pretty <adj> cool </adj>. the cocktail was fruity, sweet, and <adj> delicious </adj>. 

service could use a <adj> little </adj> bit of work. we were sat in the back of the restaurant and after our <adj> initial </adj> orders were brought out, our server slacked on refilling our water and it was <adj> hard </adj> to flag him down to make <adj> more </adj> orders.
