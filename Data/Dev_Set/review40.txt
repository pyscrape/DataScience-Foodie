this is now my <adj> favorite </adj> poke <adj> joint </adj> in seattle. their fish is <adj> fresh </adj> from hawaii and it melts in your mouth, it's <adj> crazy </adj>. they have so <adj> many </adj> assortments of sauces for their fish and it's laid out <adj> chipotle </adj> style so you have a lot of room for customization. plus the interior is <adj> super cute </adj>. 
i've also tried their dole whip float (i think that's what it's called) and their mochi ice creams and both are really <adj> good </adj>! i personally love <adj> li </adj> hing powder (which is what they put on their floats, its kind of like a plum powder??) but i do think i'd prefer just the dole whip on its <adj> own </adj>.
can't wait to go back here!
