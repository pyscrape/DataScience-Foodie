 friday  = vacation day

after reading <adj> previous </adj> reviews about dutch fred's <adj> kinky </adj> boots drink $14.00 (tito's vodka, st. germain, lemon, raspberries), i was enticed for a visit.  aside from  cyndi  lauper's broadway show, the actual  drink does exist which is  prepared  <adj> fresh </adj> complete with one <adj> fresh </adj> raspberry and one phalaenopsis orchid flower.  it is <adj> bright </adj> pink like cosmopolitan in color but <adj> subtle </adj> without the <adj> intense </adj> sweetness as it is a <adj> subtle </adj> version.  i highly enjoyed the <adj> kinky </adj> boots drink.  lunch calls for party of one was at the bar counter.  dutch fred's thankfully opens at 12 pm noon on a friday without the agony of waiting and <adj> hunger </adj> pangs to loom.  <adj> disposable </adj> coasters and business cards are available.  my server brian was <adj> attentive </adj> and readily available.  at the bottom of the bill suggested service gratuity of 18%, 20% and 22% is calculated without another <adj> other </adj> <adj> lower </adj> percentages.  dutch fred's fends the appearance of an <adj> old </adj> <adj> fashioned </adj> pub in <adj> dark </adj> lighting with <adj> wooden </adj> stools and a <adj> straight </adj> <adj> long </adj> <adj> wooden </adj> bar counter.  beneath the bar counter contains hooks for bags and jacket placement and working <adj> electrical </adj> outlets for patrons' tech gadgets to be powered.

beef burger $15.00 -ground beef chuck with the addition of <adj> monterey </adj> jack cheese was somewhat juicy of brisket blend on challah bun.  i prefer ciabatta bread for the quality and texture.  i choose <adj> french </adj> fries which were served with condiments ketchup and pink mayo ketchup (mary rose sauce).

freddy's  mule $14.00 - absolut vodka, apfel apple liqueur, lime, ginger beer with mint and mountains of ice.  too much green <adj> delicious </adj> apple flavor and ginger beer that overpowers the drink--surely not my favorite.
