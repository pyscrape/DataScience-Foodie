when your <adj> former </adj> <adj> polish </adj> co workers tell you were to go in greenpoint for the <adj> best </adj> pierogies....you go! and you are not <adj> disappointed </adj>! 

tip: go at off times! avoid <adj> popular </adj> dinner time. this is the <adj> late </adj> night snack kinda place.

i came here at like 9:45. i was amazed not to be greeted by a horde of people. the popularity of this place is clearly <adj> visible </adj> with the amount of people waiting for a table. i was <adj> able </adj> to pop a squat at the bar. at the bar you mainly just heard <adj> polish </adj> and some <adj> english </adj>. it didn't bother me at all. i felt like i was on a <adj> little </adj> vacation to poland. i knew i wanted pierogies. a mixture of mushroom and cabbage pierogies would do the trick. i ordered a <adj> small </adj> beer while i waited for my <adj> fried </adj> <adj> polish </adj> dumplings to be prepared.

 it took some time for the locals to start talking to me... but i knew it would happen. the bartender was having her <adj> last </adj> day since, she was very obviously very <adj> pregnant </adj>. i felt <adj> lucky </adj> she didn't have the baby right then an there. she has two <adj> more </adj> weeks to go. one of the regulars told me she was one of the three bartenders who was having a baby in the <adj> last </adj> <adj> couple </adj> months. there are only 7 bartenders! i thought.. i'm <adj> glad </adj> i was having the beer and not drinking the water.  

when my pierogies arrived my eyes were definitely <adj> larger </adj> than my stomach. they were tender on the inside and crispy on the <adj> outside </adj>. just the way i love them. my <adj> co </adj> workers were right. the food here is <adj> authentic </adj>, <adj> decadent </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>! i have to come back and try <adj> more </adj> of the menu. 

one of the regulars said that it wasn't the water to watch out for but the pierogies... grrrreat! too <adj> late </adj> for that. i am <adj> happy </adj> report this is a myth and you can order the pierogies with no worries but the food baby that comes after. 

i met another one of the <adj> former </adj> bartenders and she was so <adj> nice </adj> and from poland. there is a <adj> definite </adj> family environment with the staff and the regulars. they had also embraced a <adj> japanese </adj> rock star who treks from bed-stuy just to come specifically to this bar. 

this is a must stuff-your-face in greenpoint!
