yes, it's another <adj> pok </adj> place...... but aside from 45th <adj> stop </adj> n shop, i haven't been too <adj> impressed </adj> with <adj> many </adj> of the <adj> other </adj> places that have opened. but gopok is <adj> worth </adj> trying! this is as <adj> close </adj> to <adj> hawaiian </adj> poke here in seattle as you'll get.

what i like about this place is the <adj> wide </adj> variety of flavors & toppings to pick from. and there's dessert options!!! 

you can build your <adj> own </adj> pok bowl with <adj> different </adj> sizes. their king size bowl is <adj> huge </adj> btw. i got one so i could take <adj> left </adj> overs home and it was like 2 bowls in one, for only an <adj> extra </adj> $5.

my <adj> first </adj> time here i got the spicy salmon and <adj> classic </adj> ahi. normally, i'm not a fan of tuna around here because it's usually <adj> lean </adj> and too <adj> rubbery </adj>. this tuna was actually <adj> good </adj>! i really liked the <adj> classic </adj> flavor with the soy sauce and <adj> sesame </adj> oil. their spicy <adj> pok </adj> also actually has a kick to it (none of this <adj> sriracho </adj> mayo nonsense) and if you're not a fan spicy, i wouldn't get this one. <adj> overall </adj>, i think the flavor profile here is a lot <adj> stronger </adj> and less <adj> sweet </adj> like <adj> other </adj> <adj> pok </adj> places i've tried. which depending on your preference, you may or may not like. in my case, i loved it!

also yes, get the dole whip! very <adj> refreshing </adj> and tastes like how it is in hawaii :)
