used this place as a pre-theater dinner and drinks spot with my partner. we were both very <adj> satisfied </adj> with out food and drinks but couldn't get over how <adj> poor </adj> the service was.

decorated like an <adj> old-timey </adj> nyc bar, this place has plenty of bar counter and tables to accommodate <adj> many </adj> patrons. my partner and i had a reservation for dinner and were seated very promptly but that was the only thing that was timely. i don't know if the staff weren't that <adj> good </adj> or if they were overwhelmed but there seemed to only be one server for <adj> most </adj> of the tables and the lack of interaction with each table really stood out.

the cocktails are <adj> great </adj> and the prices are <adj> reasonable </adj> for being in the touristy/theater district. i was a <adj> huge </adj> fan of the smoking reverend ($14) which featured bourbon and and a <adj> red </adj> wine reduction. the food was <adj> hot </adj> and <adj> interesting </adj> and can be classified as <adj> gastropub-type </adj> fare. i was a fan of the duck confit spring rolls ($14) and the everything pretzels ($12). the spring rolls were filed with duck and came with two <adj> great </adj> sauces. the <adj> best </adj> part of the pretzels were the grain mustard and <adj> cheese </adj> sauces. there were <adj> many </adj> <adj> interesting </adj> menu items and the ones i had were executed perfectly.

<adj> overall </adj>, this place is a <adj> good </adj> option for a more <adj> casual </adj> cocktail pre-theater option. there were plenty of menu items to keep the <adj> pickiest </adj> eaters <adj> happy </adj> and there were plenty of <adj> delicious </adj> cocktails to choose from. if you can get over the lack of service, you won't be disappointed with this restaurant and bar.
