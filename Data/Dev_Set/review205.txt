before venturing to a <adj> new </adj> city we yelp the heck out of it. we found this place on yelp and then read a <adj> nice </adj> write up of it in the <adj> austin </adj> magazine in our hotel. with <adj> delicious </adj> info and pics in both it was an <adj> easy </adj> choice for dinner. 

the <adj> cool </adj> thing is the location- <adj> right </adj> off of rainey street guests will be <adj> right </adj> by fun bars and atmosphere before and after their meal. the chairs were <adj> comfortable </adj> and we were greeted <adj> right </adj> away. 

the hostess sat us and after a couple minutes the waitress came over to explain the restaurant and take drink orders. as it was explained to us the <adj> whole </adj> menu of entrees was kind of <adj> like </adj> signature tapas items that we should order 8-10 of for our 4 person group. we ordered 4 things to start and the waitress didn't seem to <adj> like </adj> that- service definitely suffered after that. the <adj> second </adj> part to the concept is that they will take forever to bring you the <adj> 4-10 </adj> menu items you order so they can bring carts of "<adj> dim </adj> sum" to your table to up sell you on <adj> more </adj> <adj> small </adj> plates. amazing marketing concept but not <adj> sure </adj> i <adj> like </adj> this at a restaurant where prices are already <adj> high </adj> for <adj> small </adj> plates. 

the <adj> first </adj> plate that came to us was a <adj> dim </adj> sum plate we ordered off the cart- it looked like an empanada- but was just a <adj> hard </adj> piece of <adj> fried </adj> crust with <adj> shrimp </adj> inside- it was called <adj> shrimp </adj> toast. the <adj> shrimp </adj> inside were <adj> great </adj>! tender and <adj> full </adj> of flavor but the empanada looking part was <adj> dry </adj> and <adj> hard </adj> to eat. <adj> second </adj> we ordered the ceviche. the flavor on it was absolutely <adj> fantastic </adj>!! kind of tasted like a slightly <adj> effervescent </adj> pineapple broth. portion wise this was 3 <adj> small </adj> bites of fish. a <adj> little </adj> <adj> tough </adj> if you have <adj> more </adj> than 3 people. 

next we had the <adj> hot </adj> potato salad with lamb. this was probably the <adj> best </adj> dish we ordered- it was a <adj> fair </adj> size - and had <adj> great </adj> flavor. it was probably enough food where if you ordered an appetizer and dessert you could be satisfied. definitely a must order. 

<adj> next </adj> appetizer that came  out was the beef tartar- no flavor at all and served with some lavash type crispy bread that was too <adj> thick </adj> to allow you to taste the flavor of the meat. quality of meat was <adj> great </adj>, sauce wasn't <adj> great </adj> and bread didn't suit the dish. 

at this point we really played the waiting game- two of our guests had ordered pasta and both dishes took over an hour to come out... a <adj> solid </adj> 30 minutes after we had finished the <adj> last </adj> dishes. the <adj> final </adj> pasta dish actually took a <adj> full </adj> hour and 15 to come out. both pasta dishes were pretty <adj> good </adj> in the end- <adj> good </adj> flavor- <adj> fair </adj> portions. 

<adj> overall </adj> it was a <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> average </adj> experience- 2 of our guests were very <adj> hungry </adj> after eating and the other 2 liked their food- none of us thought the service was friendly or up to par. the <adj> overall </adj> model of the restaurant was genius from a marketing perspective but i think some <adj> more </adj> substance or enthusiasm from the staff needs to be injected.
