i'm so late to the party that it's not even <adj> funny </adj>. i definitely don't need to harp on how <adj> great </adj> this place is since 700- others have already done so while i was living under a rock. 

but hello! decor! can whoever did the interior show me some tricks?! i loved everything about the entry way and how they used so <adj> many </adj> <adj> basic </adj> items to create <adj> such </adj> a <adj> boho-chic </adj> vibe. 

i also really <adj> loved </adj> sitting at the bar as the kitchen is <adj> open-concept </adj>. it was really <adj> cool </adj> to watch everyone at work!
