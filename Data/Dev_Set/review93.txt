buyer beware - simple is not a restaurant. it's <adj> more </adj> of a take out and <adj> to-go </adj> place, since there are no bathrooms and space is <adj> tight </adj>.

anyhow, i guess i was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> underwhelmed </adj> by <adj> simple </adj>. their bowls, are in fact, not very <adj> simple </adj> at all - i got the salmon poke bowl and it was in <adj> overladen </adj> with toppings - i much prefer pokeworks' simpler premade options, or <adj> better </adj> yet, the option to pick and choose your toppings. the food is indeed <adj> fresh </adj>, so no problems with that.
