came here for lunch today and got the king crab poke bowl. the portion size of the food is <adj> big </adj> however it's mostly <adj> rice </adj> ( your choice of <adj> white </adj> or <adj> brown </adj> or quinoa) the toppings are <adj> yummy </adj> and of <adj> good </adj> quality however <adj> mixed </adj> in felt like it was too much flavors going on. had <adj> hard </adj> time differentiating what i was eating. also the amount of king crab seem <adj> real </adj> <adj> little </adj>. the decor of the place is <adj> super </adj> cute though.
