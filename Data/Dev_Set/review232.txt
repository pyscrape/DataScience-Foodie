i had a groupon and since we were craving <adj> italian </adj>, we decided to try this place out. 
the groupon was for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, a split dessert and a wine valued up to $40 for $89. it was a <adj> great </adj> deal.
we ordered the calamari and rice balls for apps. the calamari was a bit <adj> greasy </adj> for my liking but it was still filling and the three sauces that it came with was <adj> good </adj>. i loved the rice balls. it had <adj> cheese </adj> and it came with a meat sauce. outside of the deal we ordered oysters and split a cesar salad. the oysters were <adj> good </adj> and it came with a sauce that just tasted like tabasco. it would've been <adj> nice </adj> if they had a mignonette sauce for them. the cesar was <adj> good </adj>. 
we also ordered the lobster ravioli but the bacon overpowered the lobster. the sauce was <adj> good </adj> though. 
we ordered the grass fed steak and the crab and shrimp pasta. they were <adj> great </adj> servings! we were too <adj> full </adj> to eat at this point. 
we topped it off with a bottle of syrah! which was <adj> nice </adj>. 
for dessert we had the creme brle, vanilla and espresso. unfortunately, this was a fail for us. we like the crispy too <adj> layer </adj> and <adj> char </adj> taste that it usually has but this place didn't deliver that. 
the service was really <adj> great </adj> but the food is mediocre. something was always kind of missing. i don't think we would be coming back without a groupon. i wish this place well though. it has <adj> potential </adj>.
