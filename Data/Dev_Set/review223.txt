really <adj> cute </adj> date spot.

located in a <adj> quiet </adj> willow glen.  i made reservations via <adj> opentable </adj>.  we found street parking a couple of blocks away.  

we were greeted quickly and seated at a table for 2 with <adj> candle </adj> <adj> lit </adj> tables.  when we opted for the 3 course tasting menu, we were asked if we'd like to move to a <adj> larger </adj> table.  that seemed <adj> logical </adj>.  until i noticed that it was the <adj> only </adj> table without a tablecloth and the table rocked.  that was a bit of a nuisance.

our server was friendly.  3 course tasting menu and wine pairings.  so why 3 stars?  it was <adj> ups </adj> and downs.  i enjoyed the wine pairings and my <adj> wild </adj> boar pasta.  however, i really disliked my entree, the salmon w/cherry glaze; it was too <adj> sweet </adj>.  however, i loved my dessert, the affogato al cafe, vanilla gelato w/a shot of espresso.

i'll have to give this place another try; maybe i just picked some of the <adj> wrong </adj> items.
