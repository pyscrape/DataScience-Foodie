came for their all day <adj> happy </adj> hour around 4:45pm on a sunday and luckily didn't have to wait at all! we got seated right away at a table in the back. the ambiance of this restaurant is very <adj> intimate </adj>. it's <adj> dimly </adj> lit and cozy.. as in you're literally <adj> less </adj> than a feet away from another table. definitely a <adj> romantic </adj> place to be. 

unfortunately, we were <adj> super </adj> <adj> full </adj> from our weekend of <adj> intense </adj> eating so we didn't get to try as <adj> many </adj> items on the menu as  i  would've liked. i 'll definitely be back to try <adj> more </adj>, but we got:

x  sea salt & pepper calamari ($5.50 during hh): this was <adj> good </adj>!! the calamari, like all <adj> other </adj> seafood in seattle, was <adj> fresh </adj> and chewy. easily the <adj> best </adj> calamari i've ever had.

x grilled <adj> chilean </adj> sea bass ($8 during hh): this was also <adj> tasty </adj>! my boyfriend wasn't a <adj> huge </adj> fan, but i really liked it. the sea bass was laid on top of a bed of risotto. i thought the taste of the sea bass and risotto really complemented each <adj> other </adj> well.

x <adj> red </adj> wine ($3.99): got the job done.

<adj> next </adj> time, i really want to try the gnocchi, pan roasted <adj> natural </adj> chicken with mushrooms, spicy meatballs, <adj> bacon-wrapped </adj> gulf prawns, baked broccoli, clam,  eggplant  parmigiana, or the <adj> seared </adj> ahi tuna fillet. 

if you're in seattle and looking for some <adj> great </adj> <adj> happy </adj> hour food in a <adj> romantic </adj>, <adj> dark </adj> restaurant, be <adj> sure </adj> to check our list! :)
