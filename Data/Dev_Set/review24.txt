i hear the food is <adj> great </adj>, but still need to actually try it!

day of my reservation for my fianc's birthday dinner: 

<adj> i </adj> was very <adj> excited </adj> for my fianc's <adj> special </adj> day and had been looking forward to it for some time. everyone was excitedand <adj> ready </adj> to try canlis (afew in the grouphad been customers before).<adj> i </adj> had made the reservation a month ago via "<adj> open </adj> table" and thought everything was set and <adj> ready </adj> to go until <adj> i </adj> received the voicemail confirming my reservation for "<adj> monday </adj>" instead of my <adj> original </adj> reservation for sunday. <adj> i </adj> thought this was <adj> odd </adj>, so <adj> i </adj> called back-- this is where <adj> i </adj> got your <adj> automated </adj> message stating you were closed sundays. from here <adj> i </adj> went to google as well as your website where it indicated the <adj> same </adj> thing-- no information on "<adj> holiday </adj> hours". trying to confirm this, <adj> i </adj> talked to friends in the industry, as well as one of your <adj> old </adj> chefs-- all who said you were closed sundays.

having no contact from canlis and working with the information i had from the voicemail, your <adj> automated </adj> message, and online, i concluded that you were closed. i had to scramble <adj> last </adj> minute late on a sunday to find a <adj> decent </adj> place to eat for 6 people who had already found baby sitters and made their time <adj> available </adj> for this event. after calling over 10- places i was finally <adj> able </adj> to work out something with a <adj> local </adj> restaurant of <adj> decent </adj> caliber.

while out at dinner and finally enjoying ourselves, iwas interrupted bya phone call from one of your employees stating that i had missed my reservation and would be charged $300 for the cancellation. very <adj> confused </adj> and after everything i had gone through i spoke with her regarding the situation, and she had to check with her manager to see if they could remove the fee which should never have even been considered in the <adj> first </adj> place. they finally calling later that night to inform me that you guys were not going to charge me for this. 

sent an email regarding the situation, and had one of your directors email back stating that " i will be <adj> sure </adj> to get back to you on this"-- which they never did...

<adj> i </adj>, my fianc, and our friends are still upset over this <adj> whole </adj> event. <adj> i </adj> was <adj> meticulous </adj> in my planning and communication for this event, andwe were all dressed up and <adj> ready </adj> to go, only to have the result be this. <adj> i </adj> don'tsee where imade an errorand <adj> i </adj> don't believe that canlis lived up to their end of the agreement-- and it's infuriating that you were about <adj> ready </adj> to charge me for all of this! what about our time and stress?this was not the impression <adj> i </adj> get of your restaurant, so <adj> i </adj> am not <adj> sure </adj> if this is a one time fluke or what <adj> i </adj> should do to avoid this in the future? <adj> i </adj> do not want to go through this embarrassment/headache again and waste everyone's time. not to mention that it will be <adj> difficult </adj> to get another reservation for 6 anytime soon.
