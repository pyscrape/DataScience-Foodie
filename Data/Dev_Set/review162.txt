i hate to leave anything but a <adj> perfect </adj> review.  the food is <adj> exceptional </adj> here.  each dish is clearly  cleverly crafted and executed and the service is <adj> great </adj>.  however when i brought a group for <adj> new </adj> year's <adj> eve </adj> several friends asked me, "will there be <adj> enough </adj> to eat."  <adj> legitimate </adj> question since it's definitely more <adj> gourmet </adj> servings.  i had previously eaten at the <adj> old </adj> location and there were 17 courses so while <adj> small </adj>, you left fully satisfied and thrilled with the quality.  for <adj> new </adj> year's, the set price was much <adj> higher </adj> and there was half the courses from when i had been before.  

so the meal consisted of everyone giving me the hairy eyeball and feeling like i wanted to shrink under the table.  followed up by everyone being really annoyed when the bill came and it was a fortune.  these are friends who don't mind paying a fortune for dinner but they just didn't feel they got the value.  i admit, i didn't either.  i was pretty bummed when we got in the car and they asked me to take them to in&out burger.  sigh.  not a <adj> great </adj> night.
