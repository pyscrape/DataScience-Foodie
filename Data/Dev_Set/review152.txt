the food was really <adj> good </adj>. came here <adj> late </adj> one friday night with the girlfriend and had a <adj> great </adj> dinner. the place was pretty <adj> busy </adj> so our waitress left us waiting for periods on end but that's to be expected, i guess. 

anyway, the food we had completely redeemed any deficiencies in service we experienced. we began with the avocado fundido which was <adj> fantastic </adj>. loved the <adj> sophisticated </adj> doritos vibe of the tortilla chips and the cheesy, beefy guac was <adj> perfect </adj>. we also had the truffle pomme frites and panzanella as apps which were both <adj> ptich </adj> <adj> perfect </adj>.

they ran out of the <adj> braised </adj> beef ravioli so my girlfriend went with the soba noodles instead, which she seemed to really enjoy. i had the <adj> braised </adj> beef <adj> short </adj> rib with <adj> fired </adj> onions and grits which my craving for <adj> southern </adj> <adj> red </adj> meat squarely in the spot. the <adj> perfect </adj> date spot for those looking for one.

go here.
