got the spicy salmon and bulgogi rice ball with the kichin <adj> fried </adj> <adj> chicken </adj> bowl. they hand make the rice ball right after you order it so it's really <adj> fresh </adj>. comes with three sauces for dip. they have a lot of rice in them so it's <adj> pretty </adj> filling. the <adj> fried </adj> <adj> chicken </adj> was really <adj> crispy </adj> and not <adj> greasy </adj> at all. <adj> good </adj> size portion and comes in these take out containers. there's only <adj> like </adj> 8 seats near the window so if there's space then you can eat there. 

cons: i came around opening hours so they didn't have any drinks made yet. also no <adj> hot </adj> drinks yet. cashier guy told me they're looking to add <adj> hot </adj> drinks soon including matcha!

def will come again when i'm in the area.
