dutch freds was a hip and <adj> trendy </adj> spot for dinner.  it was so crowded on a thursday night with everyone crowded around the bar.  i would rec you make a reservation because people sit and stay for a while even if it's for an <adj> early </adj> dinner.  the host was <adj> nice </adj> enough to give us a table that was reserved in an hour from that time.  the food came out quickly enough and we devoured it all quickly enough to give up that table for that reservation. 

i  seriously loved the sliders so much - they were an order of 3 sliders and each looked so <adj> juicy </adj> and <adj> delicious </adj>!  i  wish there were <adj> more </adj> for an order!! yum!!! the 2nd favorite was the chicken  wings that had a <adj> dry </adj> rub with a kick.  3rd fav was the  ny  poutine, but seriously was not the <adj> best </adj> poutine  i 've had - we were disappointed in that there wasn't <adj> enough </adj> <adj> gravy </adj> versus the <adj> cheese </adj> on it.  it was <adj> more </adj> like <adj> regular </adj> <adj> cheese </adj> fries, is that what made it ny style???  <adj> false </adj> advertising hah.  the <adj> least </adj> fav was the duck rolls - there wasn't much of a crunch to them and the duck was a bit bland.  the sauces that they provided didn't really help it, only mask how bland it was to the taste buds.  

would come back here again for <adj> more </adj> of those sliders and wings!! yum!!!  love the atmosphere of this place!
