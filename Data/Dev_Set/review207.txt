this place is absolutely <adj> delicious </adj>! the menu changes on the <adj> daily </adj> based on the availability of local ingredients and also in what foragers (who they have on staff) are <adj> able </adj> to bring in that day. 99% of all ingredients they use are locally sourced, <adj> organic </adj> and <adj> non-gmo </adj>. pretty much all the <adj> entree </adj> plates are made to share, all are relatively <adj> small </adj> so that you have room to try <adj> other </adj> absolutely <adj> delicious </adj> items on the menu. oh and a cart comes out a <adj> few </adj> times while you are dining with <adj> small </adj> bites of <adj> other </adj> <adj> amazing </adj> foods that you can (or don't have to). they call them "<adj> dim </adj> sum" but that got nothing to do with <adj> chinese </adj> cuisine, it's <adj> more </adj> for the style of delivery. some of the <adj> best </adj> dishes that all four of us loved were the sunchokes, romaine <adj> salad </adj> (not your <adj> average </adj> <adj> salad </adj>! comes with <adj> nice </adj> crispy elements), <adj> short </adj> ribs, aged pork and pasta! also crudo and makarel were also pretty <adj> amazing </adj>. beef tartar was one of our favorites from the cart and for dessert, <adj> burnt </adj> milk was so <adj> unique </adj> and <adj> tasty </adj>! honestly, everything was on point and perfectly seasoned. we all agreed that <adj> blue </adj> crab tapa from the cart was just alright, not <adj> bad </adj> but fades in comparison to everything else. we are definitely coming back again soon.
