without a doubt, list has the <adj> best </adj> <adj> happy </adj> hour deal that i have ever come across! although the restaurant exudes a much <adj> smaller </adj> and intimate setting, they still managed to accommodate our <adj> loud </adj> group of 8 without a hitch.

i honestly can't find anything <adj> wrong </adj> about each and every dish we ordered. from the <adj> grilled </adj> octopus salad to the <adj> black </adj> truffle gnocchi--everything was amazing! 

however, the dish that surpassed all our expectations and won everyone's hearts (and tummies) was the <adj> grilled </adj> chilean sea bass. how can the <adj> skin </adj> be so <adj> crispy </adj> and <adj> flavorful </adj> yet the fish itself be so <adj> moist </adj> and indulgent!? i enjoyed eating this dish because every piece was as succulent and so <adj> creamy </adj> as the <adj> last </adj>.

since we were served <adj> tapas-style </adj>, our <adj> hungry </adj> group doubled on all orders. being <adj> shy </adj> and stingy was not an option at our table. all drinks guzzled down and all plates ravishingly devoured...nothing left but exhausted livers and <adj> overstuffed </adj> tummies.

surprisingly, for a group of 8 that ordered <adj> more </adj> than 12 dishes and <adj> several </adj> rounds of drinks--our bill was under $250 (excluding tip). nothing beats a night filled with gluttony and debauchery while surrounded by a <adj> crazy </adj> bunch of starving alcoholics.

well done, list...well done =)
