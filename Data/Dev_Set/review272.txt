i love <adj> korean </adj> food but i thought this place was pretty <adj> average </adj>. granted, i only tried the bibimbap, so maybe the <adj> other </adj> dishes are better. there is also extremely <adj> limited </adj> seating, which isn't necessarily a drawback but it's something to keep in mind if you were planning to go with <adj> other </adj> people. <adj> overall </adj>, i can see how this could be a <adj> good </adj> place to grab a bite if you're in a rush, but i didn't feel like the dish i had was <adj> worth </adj> the $13 i paid for it.
