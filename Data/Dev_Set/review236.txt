i could say 3.5 star.

we sat at a bar on a <adj> late </adj> friday night. the bartender was <adj> friendly </adj> and she was on top of everyone's order even though it was a <adj> full </adj> bar. as far as the food, in my opinion the prices are way too <adj> high </adj> for the quality of food that they are serving. we ordered <adj> caprese </adj> for the appetizer and were very <adj> disappointed </adj> with it. the description says <adj> fresh </adj> tomatoes, basil, <adj> fresh </adj> mozzarella, but there was no basil and not a <adj> good </adj> mozzarella for "<adj> fresh </adj> mozzarella" 

we also ordered <adj> penne </adj> bolognese and again nothing <adj> special </adj>. i would really suggest for them to make some changes in their menu since this place has a lot of <adj> potential </adj> and can be a <adj> great </adj> <adj> italian </adj> restaurant. <adj> great </adj> location as well!
