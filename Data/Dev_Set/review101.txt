right below <adj> eighth </adj> avenue in the theater district sits this gem. this isn't a sports bar, but <adj> more </adj> like one from the prohibition days. <adj> many </adj> kicked up cocktails with <adj> funky </adj> names.

the food is <adj> good </adj> and presented nicely.  we had the poutine. it is basically fries with mozzarella and  brown  gravy. not exactly poutine that you would get in montreal, but <adj> tasty </adj> nonetheless. 

went here especially for the burgers. they were <adj> tasty </adj> and juicy. i would consider again if in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way.

our server was on point our entire meal.
