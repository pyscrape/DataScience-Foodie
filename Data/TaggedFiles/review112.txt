ever wanted a drink after a show and wanted to swoon over <adj> cute </adj> <adj> irish </adj> men with <adj> irish </adj> accents? yes, you've found the spot. they have a <adj> great </adj> cocktail program and have a lot of seats! let's face it, that's always a <adj> good </adj> thing when you're trying to talk about the show you just saw with a friend and don't want to be speaking over your neighbor.

i've only been here for drinks and some nosh but with that, i'd recommend their whiskey cocktails, their beer (which they'll let you get a taste before you fully order it) and their <adj> warm </adj> pretzels. 

also, as a bonus, one of them times <adj> i </adj>'ve been here they were holding a celebration for someone on broadway. maybe you'll sneak a peek at the person you just saw on stage! unless you're on broadway and wanted a <adj> quiet </adj> place for a meal after your show....then sorry <adj> i </adj> blew your cover.
