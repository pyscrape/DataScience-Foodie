we were introduced to vin santo yesterday thru a groupon deal; both hubby and i enjoyed our dinner experience very much.  

driving thru the tree lined <adj> willow </adj> glen neighborhood was <adj> nice </adj>, finding street parking was not too <adj> bad </adj> either on a <adj> weekday </adj> evening. service was <adj> warm </adj> and <adj> friendly </adj> from making reservation throughout the <adj> entire </adj> dinner. we were greeted warmly upon entering the restaurant, a <adj> pleasant </adj> surprise to find a one man band / singer playing in the dining room.

our waitress was very <adj> pleasant </adj> and <adj> patient </adj>, she explained the menu and how the groupon works. we picked our food based on my research of <adj> other </adj> <adj> yelp </adj> reviews.

the homemade bread was <adj> fresh </adj> and moist, not too <adj> crazy </adj> about the <adj> complimentary </adj> polenta, too <adj> much </adj> butter for our taste. we had the lobster croquet and <adj> mediterranean </adj> salad as starters, salad was very <adj> fresh </adj> and lightly dressed, the croquet was <adj> ok </adj>, didn't taste the lobster   and kind of doughy.

our <adj> main </adj> dishes were the <adj> wild </adj> boar pasta and <adj> red </adj> snapper/shrimp pasta, both were <adj> delicious </adj> and very generously portioned including the amount of protein.  we ordered the <adj> only </adj> merlot from the list and found it quite <adj> good </adj>. creme brulee was the dessert. we walked out happily with <adj> enough </adj> leftover for another meal.
