i made my way out to seattle for a birthday trip and was <adj> lucky </adj> enough to be <adj> able </adj> to make a reservation a reservation two weeks prior to the trip. it definitely increased my chances when i put was in town for a weekday. ask for a <adj> window </adj> seat! the view is <adj> amazing </adj>, even in the evening. but if you're <adj> lucky </adj> enough to get reservations during sunset, the view of lake union is beyond words!

the entry to canlis is a <adj> little </adj> <adj> tricky </adj> especially at night. it's the <adj> last </adj> <adj> right </adj> turn into what seems like an <adj> alley </adj> way. if you miss the turn, you end up going across the waters to turn around. you can only enter from one side, upon entering the driveway slopes down, so you're <adj> unsure </adj> where you are going until you see the valet. valet is <adj> complementary </adj> but tips is greatly appreciated.

the food was amazing! the salmon was <adj> soft </adj> and buttery! the drinks we're not too <adj> light </adj> but <adj> strong </adj> enough. the presentation of each dish is mesmerizing. i don't think there was anything we did not like. it's worth the price if your into <adj> fine </adj> dining.
