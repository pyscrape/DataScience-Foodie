one way i judge restaurants is by how far i would be <adj> willing </adj> to drive just to eat their food. dee dee is 4.3 miles from where we live. my family all agree that we would be <adj> willing </adj> to drive a far <adj> longer </adj> distance and time just to taste their wonderfully herbal and spicy om gai, the <adj> delicious </adj> and <adj> soul-satisfying </adj> larb moo, and even their complement of perfectly made <adj> sticky </adj> rice.

no wonder the austin chronicle's brandon watson (whose reviews we highly recommend) wrote: "when you are making food this <adj> good </adj> ... this worth the effort, you have to believe that a <adj> humble </adj> trailer is just the beginning."

dee dee's? a 10- mile restaurant in our book - not <adj> bad </adj> for a food truck!
