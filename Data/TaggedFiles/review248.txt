from the decor, service and drinks, this was to get a 5 rating. however, the <adj> few </adj> appetizers we ordered turned out to be meh, bringing down the rating a bit.

herb & bitter is a <adj> classy </adj> tapas bar on the <adj> north </adj> end of broadway in cap hill, which makes finding parking <adj> easier </adj>. this place comes highly recommended by <adj> many </adj> cocktail enthusiasts.

decor: 5
artistically decorated and tastefully lit in the <adj> right </adj> places, it gives you a <adj> good </adj> feeling as you walk in the door. the restaurant is not too <adj> large </adj>, so it's <adj> good </adj> for <adj> small </adj> groups. the ambiance is not exactly <adj> quiet </adj>, but is also a fun date place. they also have a <adj> small </adj> <adj> outdoor </adj> area in the <adj> back </adj> <adj> open </adj> during summers.

drinks: 5
we ordered four <adj> different </adj> cocktails, and all of them turned out to be <adj> excellent </adj>. i specially recommend the mood indigo if you like <adj> fruity </adj> & <adj> citrus-y </adj> drinks, and the <adj> wooden </adj> nail if you enjoy scotch & bitters based drinks. very well made and <adj> sophisticated </adj>.

tapas: 3.5
we didn't order too <adj> much </adj>, so don't take this as a place not to eat at, but what we ordered wasn't that <adj> great </adj>. we tried the papas bravas, which turned out to be steamed potatoes with some salsa and <adj> garlic </adj> aioli. the potatoes were a <adj> little </adj> <adj> raw </adj>, and not completely cooked. even the marcona almonds were bland and not well salted or seasoned.

service: 4
service is very <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> professional </adj>. however, i felt that <adj> multiple </adj> servers kept checking up on us too often and unnecessarily.

i really enjoyed <adj> most </adj> of my experience here, especially the cocktails. will definitely be coming back. this place gets my recommendation.
