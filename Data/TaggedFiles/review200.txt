i came here <adj> last </adj> week for a <adj> late </adj> holiday work dinner and had an <adj> incredible </adj> time. my coworker knew a friend of the owners, so everyone made <adj> sure </adj> to come by and say hi, which was very <adj> sweet </adj>. we started with a <adj> few </adj> appetizers (like the sunchokes, buretta cheese and homemade bread and a <adj> few </adj> others) and a bottle of sav blanc - well actually make that too!

the dim <adj> sum </adj> cart was so <adj> fun </adj>! they come around every so often after you place your <adj> main </adj> order and bring by <adj> fresh </adj> appetizers, which are a <adj> total </adj> surprise. we had oysters, tuna tartare, empanadas <adj> i </adj> believe, and a <adj> few </adj> others. keep in mind that you'll have at <adj> least </adj> <adj> 3-5 </adj> options for <adj> additional </adj> pieces of apps, but all the portions are very <adj> small </adj>. it's <adj> hard </adj> to decide what to order when you don't know what's coming around, but it all worked out. 

for dinner we tried the beef <adj> short </adj> ribs and loved them!! it came with the most <adj> divine </adj> pancake/naan bread and had to order <adj> more </adj> of the bread because it was so <adj> good </adj>. we had some pasta and a <adj> few </adj> <adj> other </adj> dishes and loved it all. 

after all the courses we were still <adj> hungry </adj> (the entrees are pretty <adj> small </adj> and can only be shared for <adj> 1-2 </adj> people) so we ordered four desserts. loved the twist on the lemon meringue dish, the pannacota and honey comb dish, and ginger ice cream sandwich. i didn't really enjoy the ice cream and blueberry pure (can't recall all ingredients).

after all four desserts we were finally <adj> full </adj> and left <adj> happy </adj>!! will be back for a date night soon!
