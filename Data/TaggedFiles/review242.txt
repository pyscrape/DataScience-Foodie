after being obsessed with their drink concoctions, i decided to come in to herb & bitter for a <adj> xmas </adj> eve dinner with my boyfriend and his brother. i was excited to try their menu, but was sorely <adj> disappointed </adj> and confused at the hodge podge of menu items. while nothing really sounded that <adj> good </adj>...we got 3 dishes to share, and that was <adj> more </adj> than enough. we ordered the: 

charcuteria: this place had some salami, chorizo, and 20 month <adj> old </adj> jamon. and <adj> macrona </adj> almonds. the chorizo and almonds were the only <adj> good </adj> thing on the dish, and <adj> i </adj>'m <adj> pretty </adj> <adj> sure </adj> <adj> i </adj> got terribly <adj> sick </adj> from that jamon. <adj> overall </adj>, the dish left much <adj> more </adj> to be desired. 

<adj> spanish </adj> adobo beef skewers: the beef skwers presentation was <adj> nice </adj>, but <adj> i </adj> think these should be renamed "<adj> salt </adj> skewers" because they were so <adj> salty </adj> and so <adj> difficult </adj> to eat. <adj> i </adj> could hardly get those down. 

pork belly with apple sauce & fig vinegar: this was one of their specials for the night, and it was easily the <adj> best </adj> thing on the menu! the pork was cut and cooked well, and the applesauce and fig vinegar really complemented the <adj> whole </adj> dish.

<adj> catalonian </adj> sauteed <adj> seasonal </adj> greens: one of the <adj> only </adj> vegetables dishes that wasn't <adj> carb </adj> loaded and sounded mildly <adj> okay </adj>. i think it may of been <adj> over-sauteed </adj>, and had way too <adj> much </adj> going on in the dish. 

if <adj> i </adj> decide to risk this place for another try, <adj> i </adj>'m definitely skipping the <adj> entire </adj> food menu and only getting drinks! so <adj> disappointed </adj> in the food, and their menu seems equally confused at what cuisine it's trying to be. still love the ambiance of the <adj> whole </adj> place, but the food is a <adj> total </adj> miss.
