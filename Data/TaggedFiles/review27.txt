i have waited about a year and a half after my <adj> first </adj> visit to write this review. to date, i have had two dinners in the <adj> main </adj> dining area (5 stars), one <adj> happy </adj> hour at the bar (4 stars), one <adj> private </adj> dinner (3 stars), and an event in the penthouse (1 star). 

the review is challenging for me to write because sometimes they go above and beyond and it's the <adj> greatest </adj> experience i have ever had, and <adj> other </adj> times, i have been so <adj> confused </adj> and frustrated with some of the staff and their decisions. 

let me <adj> first </adj> mention the food <adj> overall </adj> - it's <adj> fantastic </adj>. i preferred the <adj> previous </adj> chef but the <adj> new </adj> chef is starting to grow on me. their canlis prawns are amazing. their <adj> creme </adj> brle is out of this world. i am not a <adj> creme </adj> brle fan but you have got to try it.  their chicken is <adj> divine </adj>. i love their mushroom side dish. truthfully it's all very <adj> good </adj> (as it should be for the <adj> high </adj> ticket price). <adj> only </adj> thing i have tried that i would change is the salad was overdressed for me- way too <adj> much </adj> lemon. also the chef has a <adj> heavy </adj> hand sometimes. 

the ambience and views are amazing. the piano music in the background is <adj> fantastic </adj>. i love the service and that your car is <adj> ready </adj> the minute you walk out the door. they really know how to cater to you. 

my <adj> first </adj> dining experience (with the <adj> previous </adj> chef) was <adj> perfect </adj> from start to finish. that was the night we decided to book the penthouse so perhaps they were trying to make the sell that night. but service was <adj> spectacular </adj>. the food was <adj> outstanding </adj>. and the chef even made us a <adj> few </adj> things off menu. they really went above and beyond, and it was <adj> worth </adj> every penny. it was by far the <adj> best </adj> dining experience i have had. unfortunately it went downhill after that night. 

<adj> i </adj> had read that they were amazing for events and weddings. <adj> i </adj> read everything was so <adj> perfect </adj> and spot on, so it really sold me with this place, especially after dining here. <adj> i </adj> really didn't have a <adj> great </adj> experience, though, and <adj> i </adj> am not <adj> sure </adj> if it's because our <adj> guest </adj> count was <adj> low </adj> so they were off their game or what. (although the room rental is the <adj> same </adj> price so that shouldn't have mattered). 

issues came as our wedding approached, and a <adj> new </adj> chef came on board. the <adj> new </adj> menu wasn't released until 4 weeks before our wedding, and the restaurant was completely booked and did not want to accommodate our reservation so we could taste the food. they offered us the <adj> private </adj> room for an <adj> extra </adj> $150. what? we were pretty <adj> upset </adj> considering we were dishing out a <adj> substantial </adj> amount of money and this was beyond our control. after we complained, they comped the room which we really appreciated. but is this their standard practice? what happened to the service we received the <adj> first </adj> night? we left dinner that night a <adj> little </adj> <adj> dissatisfied </adj> as well. the <adj> new </adj> menu wasn't what we were hoping for. and we had requested one <adj> specific </adj> item to try and the chef would not serve it (<adj> i </adj> believe the pastry fell. but come on, make a <adj> new </adj> one! it's the <adj> only </adj> <adj> odd </adj> request we made, and we did it the day we booked). <adj> i </adj> knew things weren't looking <adj> good </adj>. 

as for the event itself, it was a disaster. the staff planned a weekend retreat that weekend so the event coordinator and <adj> other </adj> <adj> main </adj> staff were gone! we weren't even told this until the day before the wedding. huh?! ...it would probably be <adj> easier </adj> for me to say nothing was done correctly. my bouquet of flowers went missing, my name was misspelled on my place card, the seating chart was <adj> wrong </adj>, they served the <adj> wrong </adj> champagne, some of the food was <adj> incorrect </adj>, the <adj> wrong </adj> music was played, the sound system was so <adj> messed </adj> up during the <adj> first </adj> dances that all you could hear was <adj> static </adj>, the staff didn't synchronize me walking down the "aisle" at the <adj> right </adj> time....etc...<adj> laughable </adj> huh? <adj> complete </adj> and <adj> utter </adj> disaster. i cannot emphasize that <adj> enough </adj>. we only had 11 of us up there (all flew in from out of town). how in the world can there be that <adj> many </adj> mistakes? the coordinator emailed after the wedding apologizing for messing up the champagne, but i had to explain everything that was <adj> wrong </adj>. she assured me she would talk with her staff...so hopefully things have improved since then. i just can't imagine any place messing up as <adj> many </adj> things as they did. 

we returned a year later on our anniversary to use our $100 gift card, and luckily we got a table with a <adj> good </adj> view and enjoyed really <adj> delicious </adj> food again. unfortunately the canlis prawns weren't <adj> available </adj> nor were my two <adj> favorite </adj> drinks that have been taken off the menu. 

what happened to that <adj> first </adj> night? it's just not the <adj> same </adj> anymore. if you haven't been, i definitely recommend this place for dinner but not for an event. 

it still makes me <adj> angry </adj> visiting this place but <adj> i </adj> know <adj> i </adj> will still return. maybe one day <adj> i </adj>'ll be <adj> able </adj> to laugh at it all. it is <adj> kinda </adj> <adj> comical </adj> that <adj> i </adj> am the <adj> biggest </adj> perfectionist <adj> i </adj> know and nothing went right. haha. yeah, <adj> i </adj> don't think <adj> i </adj> am there yet...
