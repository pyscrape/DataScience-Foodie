forget comparisons to austin, there's simply is no <adj> better </adj> restaurant. don't make the mistake of choosing a dish, <adj> due </adj> the tasting menu. not only will you have the <adj> best </adj> meal of your life with depths of flavor and <adj> imaginative </adj> i gruber combos you would never dream of, but the chef typically throws in some <adj> extra </adj> courses as well. 

this restaurant has been applauded nationally for a reason, you can't learn to cook like this in <adj> culinary </adj> school. this stuff is <adj> genius </adj> level. and to be <adj> able </adj> to enjoy a sampling of their <adj> various </adj> dishes to complete a meal will give you an experience you've simply never had. 

<adj> i </adj> attended <adj> culinary </adj> school, <adj> i </adj>'ve won <adj> several </adj> awards for my cooking, <adj> i </adj>'ve had recipes published, and <adj> i </adj>'ve travelled the world...but during my <adj> first </adj> meal here <adj> i </adj> said "not only could <adj> i </adj> never dream of cooking like this in a million years, <adj> i </adj>'ve never experienced a meal like that."

it's my <adj> favorite </adj> restaurant in austin. in anywhere. and it just occurred to me <adj> last </adj> night when discussing it with others that i'd never yelped it. 

shame on me. 

also when someone raves like this <adj> i </adj> personally rarely trust the review so it should be noted <adj> i </adj> don't know anyone here at all. but <adj> boy </adj> do <adj> i </adj> admire their craft. 

it's like an artist stepping into the studio of one of the masters.
