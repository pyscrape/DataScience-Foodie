we had a really <adj> great </adj> time here <adj> last </adj> night. very, very <adj> interesting </adj> cocktail menu. i'll go back to the bar just to have the <adj> following </adj> drink at the end of a <adj> hard </adj> work day: el cuado: which is <adj> mescal </adj>, <adj> amaro </adj> montenegro, aperol, lemon

they have a really <adj> interesting </adj> and <adj> modern </adj> decor. it's a fun looking bar area. we sat down for dinner and enjoyed <adj> most </adj> every <adj> single </adj> dish. it was all very <adj> inventive </adj> and <adj> creative </adj>. there are a <adj> few </adj> dishes that we might've found to be a 4 instead of a 5, but <adj> most </adj> of it was a 5. and food is really <adj> subjective </adj> so it's <adj> hard </adj> to take away any stars just because there were a <adj> few </adj> dishes that we thought were <adj> above </adj> <adj> average </adj> instead of <adj> stellar </adj>. and when you factor in service, drink selection, decor and the food, the places is an <adj> overall </adj> 5 for <adj> sure </adj>. we will be back.
