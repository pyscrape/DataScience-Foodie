came here yesterday with some friends to enjoy some tapas and some cocktails. one of my friends confused this place with "pardon my french" which is totally <adj> understandable </adj>, <adj> i </adj> asked their owner about it and there is some <adj> friendly </adj> relation between the two chefs.

excuse my <adj> french </adj> is one of the most <adj> beautiful </adj> <adj> cocktail </adj> spots i've been to recently. the walls, the ceilings, the paintings, the lighting - everything screams <adj> romantic </adj>, vintage, artsy...it's a <adj> gorgeous </adj> place for a date. 

<adj> i </adj> had 2 cocktails here - champagne with rose reduction with an <adj> edible </adj> hibiscus flower (<adj> i </adj> felt like a princess) and an <adj> ocean </adj> mist because <adj> i </adj>'m obsessed with all things <adj> ocean </adj>-related and it's <adj> blue </adj>. both were <adj> delicious </adj>. <adj> i </adj> also got to try a cocktail that was dedicated to a <adj> french </adj> woman who died in an elevator...fascinatingly <adj> sad </adj> story, <adj> beautiful </adj> cocktail. they also brought out a <adj> special </adj> <adj> layered </adj> cocktail made for <adj> bastille </adj> day, it was made to look like the <adj> french </adj> flag and served with a pop rock rim and a rock candy skewer to to stir with. cocktails and candy? <adj> i </adj>'m sold. sign me up!

we pretty <adj> much </adj> tried all the tapas and the ones that stood out to me the most were their <adj> own-seated </adj> tuna and their <adj> grilled </adj> salmon gravlax with <adj> dill </adj> citrus marinade on toast. for dessert they brought out a <adj> sugary </adj> crepe with <adj> light </adj> orange flavor that had been drizzled with <adj> grand </adj> mariner and they lit it on fire. dessert set on fire and drizzled with alcohol? sign me up again!! the crepe was pretty <adj> good </adj>. i liked the texture but it was <adj> sugarier </adj> than i prefer.

<adj> overall </adj> my friends and i had a really <adj> great </adj> time here and i would definitely return for some more <adj> awesome </adj> cocktails!
