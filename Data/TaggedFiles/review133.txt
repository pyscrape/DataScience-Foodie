<adj> first </adj> time here in seattle, found this spot on yelp and thought to give it a try. <adj> great </adj> find! romantic/hip ambiance with the lighting. it really is a <adj> small </adj> cozy spot with a bar adjacent to dining. i wouldn't go there with <adj> more </adj> than 4 people max! there are no reservations. we got there and they were packed. <adj> grabbed </adj> drinks at the bar until a table opened up in about 30 minutes. the drinks were <adj> ok </adj>(didn't order anything fancy), bartender very friendly. 

the food was <adj> fabulous </adj>! i couldn't believe how <adj> tasty </adj> the food was and the portions for that <adj> inexpensive </adj> price. we got 3 dishes to share between 2 and it was <adj> perfect </adj>. started with the seabass, crispy <adj> outside </adj> and <adj> buttery </adj> center on <adj> kale </adj> chips and some spicy rice i think. <adj> next </adj> was the rose gnocchi which was seasoned with a <adj> creamy </adj> pink peppery sauce. lastly we got the 5oz steak with a side salad that was again very <adj> tasty </adj>. i usually <adj> eat </adj> my meat medium <adj> rare </adj> but my boyfriend likes it well done. i would definitely get it medium <adj> rare </adj> <adj> next </adj> time. 

<adj> overall </adj> <adj> great </adj> food for <adj> great </adj> price!
