what isn't to love about this place?! 

food: <adj> deeeeelicious </adj>! <adj> i </adj>'ve had poke in hawaii where it's the freshest, and this place is up to par in quality. they give <adj> generous </adj> amounts for what you pay, and the toppings just compliment the flavor of the seafood. my husband and <adj> i </adj> got the spicy tuna with octopus in the side. it was enough to satisfy the both of us, which is saying a lot cuz we are some <adj> little </adj> piggies  there are <adj> other </adj> <adj> great </adj> selections here like bento boxes, <adj> siphon </adj> coffee, <adj> bubble </adj> tea,  harney & son's tea, etc. <adj> next </adj> time we make our way back to nyc, <adj> i </adj>'d love to try it all!

ambiance: <adj> sooooooo </adj> cute! i love all the <adj> japanese </adj> mini decor & <adj> other </adj> artwork. it's <adj> clean </adj>, <adj> small </adj> (can fit about 15 people comfortably), and the workers are very <adj> sweet </adj> & <adj> friendly </adj>. it's a <adj> hidden </adj> gem inside chinatown. 

suggestions: would love if this place sold gift cards because we want our <adj> new </adj> york friends to try this place! the gift of tantalized tastebuds & quality time can't be beat. they said they are working on it.
