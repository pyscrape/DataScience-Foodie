getting to try <adj> il </adj> corvo can be an ordeal but if you make it in you are rewarded with <adj> amazing </adj> food!  they are only <adj> open </adj> on weekdays at lunch time; it's a <adj> small </adj> place and you order at the counter first before you can sit.  this leads to a <adj> long </adj> line which can be frustrating.  they only make three pastas a day, which means it's <adj> easy </adj> to try everything if you have <adj> enough </adj> people or are <adj> hungry </adj> <adj> enough </adj>.  my husband and i shared their proscuitto with <adj> pickled </adj> celery appetizer and it was <adj> delicious </adj>!  the meat was <adj> perfect </adj>.  then we shared one of each of the 3 pastas of the day and they were all so <adj> good </adj> in <adj> different </adj> ways!  you can tell it's handmade and it reminded me of the pasta at bestia in la.  i was in heaven and the food made the stress of getting to try it worth it.  i would come here whenever i have the chance!  <adj> il </adj> corvo is a must in seattle!
