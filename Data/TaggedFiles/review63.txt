i have been here on <adj> multiple </adj> occasions and each time is better than the <adj> last </adj>. 

the drinks
<adj> cheap </adj> sapporo beer - $3
cocktails in plastic bags with <adj> light </adj> up ice cubes - <adj> refreshing </adj> and <adj> <adj> delicious </adj> </adj> - $9  
<adj> i </adj> recommend the ms. cuteini if you like refreshing cucumber drinks. 

the food
here is what <adj> i </adj> recommend: avocado is a <adj> light </adj> appetizer that is so <adj> simple </adj>, but <adj> amazingly <adj> delicious </adj> </adj> . pork belly <adj> taco </adj>. crispy chicken. steak (melts in your mouth like butter). <adj> truffle </adj> mac and cheese. kimchi paella.

our group was 4 people and 2 tapas per person was <adj> more </adj> than enough. 

if you want to avoid waiting for a table show up around 6pm when it opens. if you can't get there at 6, wait until 9pm when the dinner crowd dies down. earlier in the week is less crowded. if you show up at 7:30 on a <adj> friday </adj> evening expect to wait about an hour.
