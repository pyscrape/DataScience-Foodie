stopped by just for desserts and turned out to be <adj> better </adj> than expected. had the peanut butter pie which seemed like a <adj> light </adj> mousse like texture on top of <adj> thin </adj> chocolate cake crust with <adj> perfect </adj> sweetness. it was served with chocolate icecream and <adj> crumble </adj> which completed the bite of the pie. all in all a <adj> pretty </adj> yumm dessert!
