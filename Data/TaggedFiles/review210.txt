had an <adj> excellent </adj> dinner here <adj> saturday </adj> night. ordered nearly all the dim sum, which don't come around constantly as they would in a <adj> traditional </adj> <adj> chinese </adj> dim sum restaurant; they come three times during your dinner and you get to choose from 2 or 3 options. nearly everything we had was <adj> delicious </adj>, especially the farmers cheese, charred broccoli, and the durum wheat spaghetti (<adj> best </adj> pasta dish i've had in years). look forward to going back.
