i loved this restaurant! we sat at the bar and enjoyed <adj> several </adj> <adj> small </adj> plates. the escargot was <adj> delicious </adj> and the garlic filled the air. tuna was amazing as well as the steak tartare. i loved how it was lightly seared on both sides. brussel sprouts with lamb were <adj> fabulous </adj> and we loved the cabernet we had during our meal for <adj> happy </adj> hour!
we had the opportunity to chat with the owner and co owner/chef. both were very <adj> friendly </adj> and <adj> eager </adj> to please. i will definitely be back again and again. wonderful!
