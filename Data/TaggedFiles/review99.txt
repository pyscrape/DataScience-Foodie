this <adj> mom-and-pop </adj> shop serves the <adj> biggest </adj>, <adj> baddest </adj> bowls of poke i've seen since the poke craze hit nyc! 

for me, the poke bowl is less about the <adj> fish </adj> - although the quality of the <adj> fish </adj> and the marinade are still <adj> important </adj> - and more about the toppings. <adj> simple </adj> <adj> truly </adj> delivers with a <adj> wonderful </adj> variety of toppings that come with every poke bowl, from <adj> fresh </adj> guacamole to edamame to purple and <adj> green </adj> wakame. everything was <adj> delicious </adj>! i'd knock off a half star for the quality of the <adj> fish </adj> though. i'm not <adj> sure </adj> if it is the cuts of <adj> fish </adj> themselves or the way the sashimi cubes are <adj> prepared </adj>, but my tuna had quite a bit of tendon (? the <adj> white </adj> <adj> stringy </adj> stuff) in it which made it <adj> difficult </adj> to chew thoroughly. otherwise, the <adj> entire </adj> bowl was extremely <adj> enjoyable </adj> and we devoured everything!

the <adj> cafe </adj> itself is very <adj> small </adj>, but there's quite a bit of seating. it just requires some <adj> careful </adj> maneuvering. thankfully, they do a <adj> great </adj> (and polite) job of getting people to finish up their food and relinquish their seats so that it didn't take long for us to grab seats after our food was <adj> ready </adj>, even during peak dinner hours. 

i can't wait to be back to try the bento boxes or another poke bowl!
