if you came by here 50 years ago, the grandfather i never met might've asked your bra size and sold you women's <adj> underwear </adj>. he had a store called jay ess trading company. it was a <adj> tiny </adj> les <adj> wholesale </adj> shop filled with tobacco smoke, rats, and a chill in the air that killed two <adj> pet </adj> parakeets.

we had an <adj> amazing </adj> time there tonight.

now it's excuse my <adj> french </adj>, a fully <adj> redone </adj> bar and bistro rebuilt from the ground up by our <adj> new </adj> friend ricardo and his husband. the <adj> exposed </adj> brick would've been plastered over back then, but now it covers the <adj> whole </adj> wall. it's <adj> warm </adj> and <adj> cozy </adj> and <adj> smoke-free </adj> and loaded with paintings and a <adj> sweet </adj> tin ceiling. the <adj> french </adj> chef will bark in his accent that he makes the <adj> best </adj> brussels sprouts and crepes you've ever had, and harry the server will bring you <adj> strong </adj> <adj> tasty </adj> cocktails you've never had before. ricardo took <adj> excellent </adj> care of us as our family reunited with this location after 50 years and had a <adj> great </adj> time.

roots traced. drinks drank. memories made. so <adj> great </adj>. thank you ricardo!!
