nestled in the basement excuse my <adj> french </adj> brings a bit of class to orchard street.

a <adj> long </adj> <adj> sweeping </adj> bar is the <adj> main </adj> feature with <adj> dark </adj> wood and that <adj> classic </adj> 40s vibe oozing out of the walls, check out the <adj> tiny </adj> kitchen at the end of the bar as well, talk about an <adj> open </adj> kitchen!

cocktails and <adj> french </adj> style <adj> small </adj> plates are the order of the day here. cocktails are <adj> brave </adj>, <adj> full </adj> of <adj> old </adj> world style (<adj> ie </adj> <adj> short </adj> and boozy) and not shy to get theabsinthe out when needs be, there's a lot to like on the menu.

<adj> i </adj>'m a sucker for <adj> small </adj> plates as <adj> i </adj> tend to want to try pretty <adj> much </adj> everything on the menu so <adj> i </adj>'m always <adj> happy </adj> to see a bunch of <adj> contemporary </adj> <adj> french </adj> food that <adj> i </adj> can create a <adj> nice </adj> spread from. food was all <adj> tasty </adj>, ranged from pretty to very <adj> good </adj> and it's all the <adj> right </adj> size to go, have a snack (or 6) with your boozy cocktail and feel like a hero.
