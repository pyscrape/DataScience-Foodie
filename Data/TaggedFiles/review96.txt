surprisingly <adj> good </adj>! it's <adj> amazing </adj> how this shop has not gotten the buzz and food sites write ups. it should be on everyone's list! the price points on each dish is <adj> great </adj>. <adj> affordable </adj> for the <adj> fresh </adj> seafood and/or curry dishes. service was <adj> wonderful </adj> and you could see it's family owned vibe.

<adj> i </adj> went with the ahi tuna bowl with <adj> brown </adj> rice. all ingredients were <adj> fresh </adj> and the tuna was seared perfectly with a <adj> large </adj> portion of tuna. the accompanying ingredients all matched well for the bowl <adj> such </adj> as the <adj> garlic </adj> chips, asago, seaweed salad, and pickled vegetables. filling and satisfying for a meal. <adj> small </adj> spot with a <adj> long </adj> table and a table for two with <adj> most </adj> folks either taking our or eating quickly.

i'll definitely be back and will go for the curry katsu <adj> next </adj>.
