goodness, what a place. coming in, i didn't expect <adj> such </adj> a <adj> top-notch </adj> experience at barley swine. we got to sit right in front of the kitchen, <adj> front-row </adj> seats to the <adj> constant </adj> hustle and bustle of line cooks and <adj> sous </adj> chefs working the floor.

in order of what was served...

<adj> grilled </adj> strawberries
definitely an <adj> interesting </adj> texture take on strawberries with <adj> snap </adj> pea and chevre. i was a fan.

pig skin noodles
these were quite <adj> good </adj>, with an <adj> added </adj> kick from the <adj> hot </adj> sauce blended with shrimp and scallops. i could've eaten a <adj> giant </adj> bowl of these.

grilled carrot
a nicely <adj> prepared </adj> <adj> dish </adj> - not one of the standouts, but definitely <adj> tasty </adj>.

poached <adj> red </adj> snapper
you cannot go <adj> wrong </adj> with <adj> koji </adj> butter, no matter what you do. pair this decadent <adj> koji </adj> butter with a <adj> perfect </adj> piece of <adj> poached </adj> <adj> red </adj> snapper and you have an extraordinarily savory, <adj> delicious </adj> dish.

parley croissant
quite, quite <adj> good </adj>. the bone marrow has <adj> more </adj> of a <adj> foie </adj> <adj> gras-like </adj> texture but still butter, <adj> rich </adj> and so, so <adj> good </adj>. the parsley croissant was <adj> flaky </adj> and <adj> delectable </adj>. 

blackened octopus
another <adj> great </adj> dish. the pork fried rice was amazing. the octopus was well flavored and nicely tender.

fried chicken
like candy, with its skin coated with <adj> smoked </adj> <adj> fish </adj> caramel. the pickles were a <adj> nice </adj> touch.

duck
this was the one dish that i expected just a bit more from. definitely a <adj> great </adj> piece of duck, but could have been a bit <adj> softer </adj>. beet and strawberry were <adj> great </adj> additions though.

grapefruit sorbet
extremely refreshing, with the combination of jasmine and beet. mmmm.

peanut monte blanc
seeing this on the menu, i was a <adj> little </adj> <adj> worried </adj> that this would be really <adj> sweet </adj> - with ingredients like honey, <adj> dark </adj> chocolate and ginger - but it was absolutely <adj> perfect </adj>. a <adj> little </adj> <adj> nutty </adj>, a <adj> little </adj> crunchy. so <adj> good </adj>.

it's a dinner that will take up <adj> most </adj> of your evening - it lasted roughly 2.5 hours - but it was really <adj> quite </adj> <adj> nice </adj>. the service was <adj> great </adj> and the food... so worth it.
