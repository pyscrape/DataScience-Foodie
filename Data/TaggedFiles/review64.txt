this was my <adj> first </adj> time trying <adj> korean </adj> tapas and it was exactly what i was looking for during <adj> happy </adj> hour. not only do they have <adj> cheap </adj> drinks starting at $3 for a sapporo, but you get a <adj> free </adj> glass of beer if you check-in between 6-630pm. 

entree: their pork belly tacos were <<adj> adj </adj>> simply amazing </<adj> adj </adj>>, however, they are a bit pricy for the <adj> small </adj> portion that you do get. but, overall the tender meat and the addition of the <adj> perfect </adj> combination of sauces make it worth the price. my friend and i also got the kimchi paella, which had <adj> generous </adj> portions of both tiger shrimp and muscles inside the dish. the flavors of the cheese, kimchi, and seafood came together well and made it a <adj> delicious </adj> dish. while the portions of the taco were <adj> small </adj>, my friend and i found that one taco each and splitting an order of kimchi paella was filling enough.
