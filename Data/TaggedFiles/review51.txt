hopelessly, inevitably, in love with gopok. infatuated, stuck in cupid's chokehold like it's two weeks into <adj> february </adj>. momma tells me it's just a phase, <adj> i </adj>'m tellin' her it's the <adj> real </adj> thang!

wow, can i just tell you that gopok is just perfection for me? as a place that i have been awaiting it's <adj> grand </adj> opening for the <adj> longest </adj> time, i can tell you that it was totally <adj> worth </adj> it. you know the saying, "<adj> good </adj> things come to those who wait"? giiiiiirl let me tell you, patience is truly a virtue that i learned with this place! after finally having their <adj> <adj> delicious </adj> </adj> food, my life honestly came <adj> full </adj> circle.

my two fave items to get here are the <adj> classic </adj> ahi and the <adj> classic </adj> salmon. <adj> dee-lish </adj>. straight and to the point. the cuts of <adj> fish </adj> taste like savory <adj> delectable </adj> pieces of finger jell-o (it sounds very <adj> appetizing </adj>, lol i know, you're <adj> welcome </adj>!!). for a <adj> plain </adj> jane <adj> simple-ten </adj> girl like me, they definitely get my seal of approval. i'm not a fan of having too <adj> much </adj> sauce (<adj> cue </adj> dj esco song) because i actually enjoy the lingering taste of the ocean while eating <adj> raw </adj> <adj> fish </adj> -- as to others would be a surprise!

the pok is already <adj> pre-marinated </adj> at this <adj> wonderful </adj> establishment. shoyu levels on both mixes are at a <adj> great </adj> level here. one thing that i would have to say is that the onion levels might be a bit <adj> overwhelming </adj> by some. luckily for me, i looooove me some onions, so it doesn't really bother me <adj> much </adj>! 

i also enjoy the fact that they don't have an <adj> extensive </adj> topping bar compared to <adj> other </adj> <adj> pok </adj> bars poppin' up in seattle. quite frankly, it only takes away the focus from the <adj> main </adj> star -- the <adj> pok </adj>!

the moment <adj> i </adj> discovered that this place also served desserts, <adj> i </adj> was <adj> dancin </adj>' in my seat. when <adj> i </adj> realized that they served <adj> hawaiian </adj> desserts -- shave ice, bubbies mochi & <adj> dole </adj> pineapple whip.... <adj> i </adj> freaked the funk out! how did this place know me so well?! it just knew all my <adj> weak </adj> spots, and <adj> i </adj> wasn't <adj> sure </adj> if <adj> i </adj> liked that or not! ;)

the employees here are also <adj> super <adj> awesome </adj> </adj>. i'm <adj> embarrassed </adj> to say that we come here so often that they've picked up our names (and our <adj> usual </adj> orders). they welcome us with <adj> open </adj> arms every time we step through the doors! talk about ohana for life! 

<<adj> adj </adj>> gopok </<adj> adj </adj>> gets five stars from me. they serve <<adj> adj </adj>> <<adj> adj </adj>> exceptional </<adj> adj </adj>> </<adj> adj </adj>> food and their service is <<adj> adj </adj>> amazing </<adj> adj </adj>>. like the saying, "it ain't trickin' if ya got it", their team represents the 808 to the <adj> fullest </adj>! keep doin' what you guys do!
