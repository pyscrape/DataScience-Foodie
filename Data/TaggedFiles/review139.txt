quality of <adj> food-the </adj> gnocchi is what they're know for and it was <adj> delicious </adj>! we also tried the shrimp wrapped in bacon, which i loved. and the calamari was way too salty for its <adj> own </adj> <adj> good </adj>. we only had a <adj> few </adj> bites. menu is <adj> extensive </adj> and prices are definitely a <adj> happy </adj> thought.
