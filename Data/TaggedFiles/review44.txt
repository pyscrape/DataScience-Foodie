<adj> typical </adj> <adj> low-end </adj> buffet quality sushi.  the reason students rate this so highly is because they can't cook anything <adj> other </adj> than ramen noodles and rice at home.  lol.  <adj> i </adj>'ve gotten better quality quality poke at a <adj> local </adj> kroger (qfc or fry's).  

while the service was <<adj> adj </adj>> good </<adj> adj </adj>> and the workers <<adj> adj </adj>> passionate </<adj> adj </adj>>, the freshness of sushi suffers.  management really needs to look into not serving sushi that has gone <adj> bad </adj>.  some of the sushi tasted like it went <adj> bad </adj>.  i only ate one or two <adj> bad </adj> pieces and threw the rest away.  even then, i felt a <<adj> adj </adj>> nauseated </<adj> adj </adj>> feeling hours later.

<adj> overall </adj> at <adj> best </adj> this is <adj> low-end </adj> sushi buffet quality, at <adj> worst </adj>, you can get <adj> sick </adj> eating this.
