my sister and i came in around 1:30pm on a monday and the wait wasn't too long. it took us around 25 min to wait in line, order and get our food. 

atmosphere;
it's a pretty <adj> small </adj> place with seating for around.. <adj> 20-30 </adj> people? but <adj> i </adj> think it makes it that <adj> much </adj> <adj> homier </adj> and cozy
seating is <adj> communal </adj> style. the <adj> only </adj> <adj> negative </adj> thing about that might be the noise level
 the servers bring the pasta and dishes to you but you have to get your <adj> own </adj> water and utensils. you also have to bus your <adj> own </adj> tables after!

food;
we ended up ordering all three of the pasta specials that they had as well as their homemade focaccia. it was a lot to share between the two of us  but it was <adj> worth </adj> trying everything. 
 the focaccia was crispy on the <adj> top </adj> because of the <adj> melted </adj> cheese but the bread is very <adj> soft </adj> and dense. it was the <adj> perfect </adj> starter and it's <adj> worth </adj> trying!
 the pastas are cooked al dente which is the <adj> best </adj> way to be eaten and each dish wasn't drowning in sauce like some <adj> other </adj> places might have it. some might consider it to be a <adj> little </adj> too salty but it wasn't <adj> bad </adj>. 
 the shapes and textures of the pastas also complimented the sauces really well. <adj> overall </adj> really <adj> yummy </adj> pastas 

cost;
 for 9$ a dish, its one of the <adj> best </adj> prices for <adj> such </adj> a <adj> good </adj> meal! the portions are <adj> perfect </adj> for lunch

<adj> overall </adj>;
i think it's <adj> worth </adj> waiting the line for! definitely try it out when you have <adj> enough </adj> time for lunch!
