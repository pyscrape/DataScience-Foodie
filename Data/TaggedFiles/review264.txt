<adj> such </adj> an <adj> awesome </adj> option for a <adj> quick </adj> lunch or dinner in the area, whether you're picking up or getting delivered ($20 minimum). there's not <adj> much </adj> else to choose from in that <adj> immediate </adj> area besides a mcdonald's, a dunkin donuts, and a <adj> halal </adj> cart, so <adj> i </adj> was very <adj> grateful </adj> to find out about this relatively <adj> healthy </adj> <adj> korean </adj> spot. 

the guys behind the counter are so <adj> helpful </adj> and <adj> friendly </adj> and they'll gladly make any recommendations if you're not <adj> sure </adj> where to start. <adj> i </adj> can never go <adj> wrong </adj> with a bowl, so that's where <adj> i </adj> typically end up, but the rice balls look amazing too. <adj> i </adj> suggest the bulgogi, grilled chicken, or <adj> salmon </adj> bowls, and don't forget to wash it down with their <adj> incredible </adj> honeydew <adj> white </adj> tea which they make in house. <adj> i </adj> was disappointed by their soggy and <adj> broken </adj> veggie dumplings and by the sauce that leaked all over the inside of my bag, but <adj> i </adj>'m <adj> willing </adj> to let it go because everything else <adj> i </adj>'ve had is so <adj> tasty </adj>. 

there's not <adj> much </adj> of a <adj> dining/sit-in </adj> area to speak of, but luckily <adj> most </adj> of their items are very <adj> portable </adj> and perfect for a grab and go situation. even better, they sell <adj> pocky </adj> sticks at the counter - my <adj> favorite </adj> snack! 

i'm rooting for these guys as they seem to put a lot of heart into their food and i think it's a <adj> great </adj> addition to the marcy stop block. go check them out!
