came here for a date night and <adj> i </adj> absolutely loved it! boyfriend did a <adj> great </adj> job picking out the place. it's <adj> super </adj> cute inside and the drinks look so pretty. we couldn't get a reservation for 2 so we had to sit by the bar and entertained ourselves with a <adj> few </adj> drinks for the <adj> first </adj> 30 minutes. the mule in the copper cup was <adj> strong </adj> and <adj> i </adj> preferred the magner cider over the <adj> pineapple </adj> sculpin ipa.

the ahi tuna salad was my <adj> favorite </adj> dish of the night. it was a <adj> decent </adj> size portion and it was crusted with <adj> black </adj> and <adj> white </adj> sesame seeds outer layering. pork sliders were <adj> delicious </adj> and the meatball lollipop were juicy! i really <adj> missed </adj> poutine from montreal so we decided to order it here. it wasn't exactly the <adj> same </adj> to compare, but it was okay. they used mozzarella <adj> cheese </adj> instead of cured <adj> cheese </adj> and the gravy wasn't as <adj> thick </adj> as i expected. some sausages on top would have made a world of wonder. but <adj> overall </adj>, loved the service and the ambiance.
