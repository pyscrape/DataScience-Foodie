<adj> incredible </adj> from beginning to end. we came here expecting "<adj> good </adj>" and received "<adj> outstanding </adj>". i have to add emmer & rye to the <adj> premier </adj> list, along with <adj> uchi </adj> and laundrette.

there were 2 of us and we lucked out with seats at the chef's counter (there are only 4 spaces). was <adj> great </adj> to watch and interact with the kitchen - a well <adj> oiled </adj> machine on a <adj> busy </adj> saturday night. 

highlights were the <adj> fresh </adj> cheese with <adj> smoked </adj> <adj> shishito </adj> relish, the <adj> blue </adj> crab with potato, arugula and roe, and the <adj> roasted </adj> <adj> shishito </adj> peppers with <adj> bread </adj> crumbs and gruyere. among the <adj> best </adj> things i have tried in austin this year. i also quite enjoyed the simplicity of the rigatoni with <adj> fresh </adj> tomatoes. the pasta was perfectly <adj> prepared </adj> and seasoning was spot on.

there was a butternut <adj> squash </adj> dish on the dim <adj> sum </adj> cart that was much more <adj> delicious </adj> than one would expect. unfortunately we skipped dessert, as we had already had a <adj> sweet </adj> cocktail and a <adj> few </adj> glasses of wine. <adj> next </adj> time i will prepare better. 

service was very <adj> friendly </adj> and kept hustling. that said, <adj> i </adj> never felt rushed or ignored. truly it was a standout experience.
