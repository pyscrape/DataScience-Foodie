so <adj> glad </adj> i finally got to try this place! i remember when they first opened, they were serving brunch but it looks like they're just <adj> open </adj> for dinner now. my boyfriend and i were here on a <adj> tuesday </adj> night and got <adj> lucky </adj> with no wait. the food and service is <adj> spectacular </adj>! our server was very <adj> friendly </adj> and explained every dish that we ordered). the food is <adj> tapas </adj> style - very <adj> reasonable </adj> priced and the portions are <adj> great </adj> (unlike <adj> many </adj> <adj> tapas </adj> places that skimp on portions - overcharge).

for the capri suns, we both got the lychee reach <adj> rich </adj>. so <adj> yummy </adj>! it has lychee - mango.

this is what we ordered (in the order it came out):

pork belly <adj> taco </adj> ($6): this is a <adj> single </adj> <adj> big </adj> <adj> taco </adj> that they cut into two pieces. there's nothing <adj> super </adj> interesting about this <adj> taco </adj>, but the pork belly was very <adj> good </adj>. the sauces meshed well together.

kimchi paella ($12): so so so <adj> delicious </adj>. it comes <adj> white </adj> tiger shrimp, mussels, and <adj> caramelized </adj> kimchi. the consistency of this <adj> dish </adj> definitely resembles risotto <adj> more </adj> than a paella. it's very <adj> creamy </adj> and packed with flavor. the <adj> caramelized </adj> kimchi really stood out to us. a- highly recommend this <adj> dish </adj>.

truffle mac and <adj> cheese </adj> ($9): star of the night! this is definitely one of the <adj> best </adj> truffle mac and <adj> cheese </adj> i've ever had in my life. it's <adj> sooo </adj> cheesy. there are clams in this dish and added a really <adj> nice </adj> chewy texture. although it's <adj> small </adj>, it's so <adj> filling </adj> because of all the pasta and <adj> cheese </adj>.

steak ($12): we weren't asked how we wanted our steak, but it came out medium rare (<adj> perfect </adj>!) the steak is <adj> good </adj>, but definitely not their signature. the sauce, <adj> soy-garlic </adj> glaze, is really <adj> great </adj> with the grits. the kale is drenched in the sauce as well.

matcha bread pudding ($9): this reminds me of lava cake since they add <adj> ice </adj> cream on top. the bread pudding has a really <adj> nice </adj> flavor but a <adj> little </adj> too <adj> mushy </adj> for my liking.

<adj> i </adj> think for two people, you can definitely get away with just three dishes (which is amazing for a place that's supposed to be <adj> tapas </adj> style!) we were so <adj> stuffed </adj> after the meal, but definitely <adj> super </adj> satisfied. <adj> i </adj>'m so excited to come back and try the <adj> other </adj> dishes!
