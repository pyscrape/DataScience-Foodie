went here for <adj> happy </adj> hour on a <adj> wednesday </adj> night. it was decently <adj> busy </adj>, but not overcrowded or <adj> uncomfortable </adj>. 

the <adj> good </adj>:

<adj> great </adj> selection of wines and a <adj> nice </adj> cocktail menu. plates are <adj> tapas </adj> style, which are <adj> great </adj> for those looking to share a variety of bites. 

we ordered the handmade gnocchi with <adj> black </adj> truffle oil and it was divine. 10/10 would recommend. if i hadn't been on a <adj> first </adj> date, i would've eaten <adj> much </adj> <adj> faster </adj> and ordered another plate for myself. plates are served with <adj> complimentary </adj> <adj> rustic </adj> bread and <adj> pesto-infused </adj> <adj> melted </adj> butter, which, again, i would've devoured <adj> much </adj> more rapidly had i not been on a <adj> first </adj> date. 

the <adj> other </adj> dishes that came out looked equally <adj> beautiful </adj> and <adj> well-prepared </adj>, so this is the <adj> perfect </adj> spot if you're looking for a <adj> quasi-bougie </adj> dinner at half the <adj> normal </adj> price with a <adj> nice </adj> drink to go along. 

the <adj> bad </adj>:

the lighting is a <adj> little </adj> dim, which is <adj> good </adj> for <adj> first </adj> dates if you're feeling physically <adj> self-conscious </adj> (i.e., you'll be less <adj> visible </adj>) and <adj> bad </adj> for pretty <adj> much </adj> everything else, but that's the <adj> only </adj> knock i have on the place. at one point the <adj> tiny </adj> candle on our table for two went out, and i couldn't be <adj> certain </adj> my date was still across the table. luckily our server was <adj> quick </adj> on the relight, and i was <adj> able </adj> to confirm that yes, he was still there. 

<adj> good </adj> spot. i'd go again for <adj> happy </adj> hour wine and <adj> shareable </adj>, <adj> fancy </adj> food.
