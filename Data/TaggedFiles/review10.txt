oh lord, there are seven <adj> hundred </adj> reasons why trailers are annoying, but one reason to go - because the food's <adj> great </adj>. it's the <adj> shortest </adj> distance between a chef's "this is what <adj> i </adj> do," and your "give me your <adj> best </adj> shot." <adj> i </adj>'ll take dee dee any day.

i know nothing about <adj> authentic </adj> <adj> thai </adj>, and this niche of "<adj> northern </adj> <adj> thai </adj> street food" appears to involve lots of <adj> minced </adj> pork with <adj> home-grown </adj> basil. and lots of <adj> sticky </adj> rice. <adj> wonderful </adj> stuff. chef lakana is also experimenting with <adj> fish </adj> sauces, and i could do her <adj> grilled </adj> pork skewers all day.

the dee dee trailer is sharing a lot with la bbq, on <adj> east </adj> cesar chavez next to stay gold and drink's lounge. this area was hopping on a <adj> sunday </adj> afternoon, but it was <adj> easy </adj> to find street parking. they've been <adj> open </adj> <adj> less </adj> than a week, they're <adj> excited </adj>, we're <adj> excited </adj> for them, and you just want them to do well. if <adj> i </adj> run into you here, <adj> thai </adj> tea on me.
