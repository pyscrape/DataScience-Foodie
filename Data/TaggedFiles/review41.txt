<adj> first </adj> time here and tried the 12th man bowl. people working there are really <adj> friendly </adj>. <adj> overall </adj> it was <adj> good </adj> although one or <adj> several </adj> of the poke was too <adj> spicy </adj> for me. i've actually never encountered that sort of spice before with poke even when we order the <adj> spicy </adj> option. so just letting you know. husband felt the <adj> same </adj> with his aloha bowl.

sampled the <<adj> adj </adj>> dole </<adj> adj </adj>> whip and it was <<adj> adj </adj>> really <adj> good </adj> </<adj> adj </adj>> and calmed down that spice episode i was experiencing. 

will probably be back if i'm ever in that area and order the non spicy option.
