super <adj> happy </adj> with this place! came here to celebrate the bachelorette party of a <adj> good </adj> friend and they put us in a <adj> huge </adj> booth by the window. their cocktails are <adj> delicious </adj> and their food is incredibly well done. plus it's <adj> helpful </adj> that a lot of their food doesn't have flour in it for <adj> gf </adj> folks like me.

their cocktail menus are adorably kept in kids books, and their checks are brought to you in wallets. everything about this place is <adj> super </adj> well thought out, and tastefully done. from <adj> endless </adj> cucumber water to perfect <adj> sized </adj> portions with the prices to match. this place place is a hit. 

not to mention, the service was on point for a <adj> friday </adj> night.
