(review from september) <adj> i </adj> have been here twice in the <adj> last </adj> 3 weeks and again <adj> last </adj> night. <adj> i </adj> will be bringing friends here for <adj> more </adj> visits for <adj> sure </adj>.  <adj> thursday </adj> kitchen consistently blew me out of the water with the food and service.  <adj> i </adj> think <adj> i </adj>'ve waited for <adj> 20-30 </adj> minutes for a table for <adj> 3-4 </adj> people at around 8:30pm. <adj> i </adj>'ve also been here right when dinner service starts and no wait of course. at this point think at this point <adj> i </adj>'ve had everything on the menu and really can't go <adj> wrong </adj>.  the mac and cheese and the <adj> fried </adj> chicken is a <adj> crowd </adj> pleaser.  

the drinks are <adj> cash-only </adj> bar so <adj> bring </adj> cash. their <adj> light-up </adj> capri-sun-like drink containers are <adj> innovative </adj> and fun...oh yeah and the drinks are <adj> great </adj> too.   <adj> i </adj> recommend the jeremy drink!!

on one visit something was <adj> wrong </adj> with my dish and after bringing it to the attention of the staff, they were extremely <adj> responsive </adj> and <adj> attentive </adj>. <adj> i </adj> think 4 staff apologized to me directly and they gave me a replacement dish on the house.  <adj> i </adj> really appreciated their attention to my satisfactions and have been referring everyone to patron this place since. <adj> i </adj>'ll be back soon <adj> i </adj>'m <adj> sure </adj> :)
